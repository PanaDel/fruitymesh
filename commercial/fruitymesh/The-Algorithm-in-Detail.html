<p>The final algorithm is presented here and offers a solution for building
a graph which is only based on the knowledge of surrounding nodes. It
enables automatic meshing that is functional and constructs a spanning
tree with all reachable nodes. Loop building is effectively prevented.
It is self-healing in case of node loss or short-lived node failure and
can be optimized for a number of use-cases by customizing a cluster
score function. This results in different spanning
tree configurations. Nodes can be switched on at different times and
even after the route setup has finished.</p>

<h2 id="_the_idea"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_idea"></a>The Idea</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every node is always part of a cluster with a unique <strong>Cluster Id</strong> which
is generated by the founding member. A single node with no connections
represents a cluster with the size of one. Only nodes that are part of
different clusters will connect to each other and exchange their cluster
information. This information is evaluated in the <strong>Cluster Score</strong>
function. The node that is part of the bigger cluster can decide which
connections it wants to make and will convert nodes from smaller
clusters to its own cluster. The increased cluster size must then be
reported back to the rest of the cluster. Size information will be
passed through the existing connections which is an energy efficient way
of distributing information. If nodes disconnect from a cluster either
voluntary or because of timeouts, the size of the cluster must be
decreased according to the number of nodes that were lost. This requires
each node to save the quantity of connected nodes for each active
connection.</p>

<h2 id="_node_initialisation"><a class="anchor" href="#_node_initialisation"></a>Node Initialisation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before a node can join a network, it must be assigned a <strong>Node Id</strong> and a
<strong>Network Id</strong>. In case of an encrypted network, it must also possess the
network encryption key that will be shared among all nodes in the
network. The Node Ids do not have to follow a scheme but must be unique
for that network. The Network Id allows different networks to coexist in
the same physical space. These values are configured in the enrolment
process. After booting, a node generates a new <strong>Cluster Id</strong> based on its
Node Id and the total number of connection losses. The initial <strong>Cluster
Size</strong> of a node must be set to 1. A value called <strong>Connected Cluster
Size</strong> must be saved for each of the possible connections (1 outgoing, 3
incoming) and is initialized with 0. 7 depicts a node that is directly
connected with two other nodes and gives an overview of the stored
values.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_discovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_discovery"></a>Discovery</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the discovery phase, a node will constantly broadcast its Node
Id, Cluster Id and its Cluster Size in an advertising packet. This
packet has been called the <strong>JOIN_ME</strong> packet and can also include further
attributes that other nodes use to calculate the <strong>Cluster Score</strong>. The
advertising packet must be connectable if the incoming connection is
still free, otherwise it is non-connectable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Between sending these advertising packets, a node must scan on all
advertising channels for packets of surrounding nodes. These are
collected in a buffer and only the most recent packet from a node is
saved with a timestamp of the reception time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_route_setup"><a class="anchor" href="#_route_setup"></a>Route Setup</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a predefined amount of seconds, a node calculates its best
connection partner based on the collected JOIN_ME packets. At first, it
looks for nodes that have a freeIn connection and tries to connect as a
master. Each packet is evaluated with the Cluster Score function, which
returns a connection score. This score is zero if the node belongs to
the same cluster or if the other cluster is bigger. (If both are
similar//TODOm: similiar or the same?/ in size, the Cluster Id is used to
determine the winner). After processing all packets, the algorithm tries
to connect to the highest ranked node. Therefore, it needs to listen for
another advertising packet which it will answer with a connection
request. In case of success, the two nodes must then perform a
handshake.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before the handshake is finished, the newly connected node cannot
participate in the network and must not send any packets except those
belonging to the handshake. Both nodes start the handshake by sending a
<strong>CLUSTER_WELCOME</strong> packet which includes the latest information about
their Cluster Size and Cluster Id because the available information
might already be outdated. This can result in a few different cases:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>a) If they already belong to the same cluster, they must
disconnect because they are already linked through other nodes. This is
done to ensure that there is not more than one link between nodes of the
same cluster.
in the same network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>b) If they have different Cluster Ids, one of the nodes will have
a smaller Cluster Size (In case they are equal, the value of the nodeId
decides). This node must then disconnect all other connections and must
join the bigger cluster. It saves its new Cluster Id and the Cluster
Size which it increments by one. Afterwards, it sends a <strong>CLUSTER_ACK</strong>
packet to its connection partner that confirms its entrance to the
cluster. This marks the end of the handshake. After the partner has
received this packet it will increment the Cluster Size and it will send
a <strong>CLUSTER_UPDATE</strong> message to other nodes that informs them of the size
change. The packet contains either a size increment or decrement and not
the absolute size of the cluster. Sending the absolute value would not
work because there is no guarantee that all nodes hold the same Cluster
Size at one time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cluster Size decrements will be sent as soon as a node encounters a
disconnection for any reason. Because it knows the number of nodes that
were connected through this connection, it can send the appropriate
decrement message. This even works in a situation where the other node
fails to respond and a timeout is generated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After disconnecting from nodes of the same cluster, there are two
separated networks with the same Cluster Id. Because that would result
in the forming of islands (disjoint clusters), the smaller cluster has
to distribute a new Cluster Id. The new Cluster Id is sent with the same
CLUSTER_UPDATE packet that contains the size decrement after a
connection was lost. The new Cluster Id is based on the Node Id that
just lost the connection. To generate the new Cluster Id, the connection
loss counter is merged with the Node Id to ensure that the same Cluster
Id is not in use twice which would result in two disjoint clusters with
the same id.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_route_maintenance"><a class="anchor" href="#_route_maintenance"></a>Route Maintenance</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nodes that belong to bigger clusters can always decide which connections
are made and will dissolve smaller clusters. If adjacent devices are
switched on one by one, they can instantly connect to the mesh. But if
two different cluster meet at one point, the bigger cluster will force
the small cluster to reform until there is only one cluster left.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the network has been formed, the JOIN_ME packets will all
advertise the same Cluster Id. This will gradually cause all nodes to
switch to a lower discovery mode when no changes are detected for a long
time. They will then scan the network less frequently and send fewer
advertising messages. It is possible to switch off discovery entirely
after all known nodes have connected to the network but this will
prevent any new nodes from joining the network. If a node is
disconnected, it will be able to join again because its previous
connection partner will notice the disconnection and will then switch on
discovery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The network will always try to reconnect to disconnected nodes because
they will have a different Cluster Id after the disconnection.
Alternative routes are formed as well which means that the network is
self-healing.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_routing"><a class="anchor" href="#_routing"></a>Routing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Routing in the spanning tree of the network has not been a major focus
because of the variety of solutions that are already available. Some
ideas and thoughts are provided for a number of different types of
messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Broadcast messages</strong> do not require any form of routing. A broadcast
message can originate from either a sink or from any node in the
network. It is then retransmitted through every connection except the
connection from where it was received.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Node to sink messages</strong> are considered to be another common message
type. If we assume that the number of sinks in a network is a low number
then each node can hold a simple routing table that contains the Node Id
of each sink and the appropriate connection with which they can be
reached. This information must be broadcasted by a sink when it
initially joins the mesh and is propagated with the CLUSTER_UPDATE
messages. When coupling this information with a hop counter, it is
possible to route information to the closest sink when required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One can also use a simpler implementation where each connection is only
denoted with a Boolean that specifies whether any sink is reachable
through this link or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Node to Node messages</strong> are the most complex scenario because a node may
not be able to hold a full routing table with its limited memory
resources. In this case, distributed routing tables, data centric
routing or other techniques must be considered for optimization.
Otherwise, messages will need to be broadcasted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Sink to Node messages</strong> are similar to the previous category. In many
scenarios, a sink will be connected to another network or to a device
with more resources in terms of processing power and memory. This device
can hold a number of network quality measurements and an inventory of
connected nodes. If each node provides its connection partners it is
then possible to build a full routing tree and use this information for
more intelligent routing e.g. by adding routing information to a packet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some use-cases will also require to separate the network in a number of
groups. If the number of groups is low enough to be kept in memory, each
node may employ a routing table for routing to different groups.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="_evaluation"><a class="anchor" href="#_evaluation"></a>Evaluation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simulation has been implemented to evaluate the proposed algorithm. A
number of improvements have been incorporated to tweak the algorithm&#8217;s
performance based on this simulation. In its final form, the algorithm
produced a connected mesh network in all cases in a number of
simulations. Routing has not been implemented and only broadcast
messages are supported. Some of the simulation results are shown in the
next section.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A number of different node setups have been evaluated and the simulation
results have been plotted. All nodes were switched on at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simulation shows that most networks look random at the beginning but
once a bigger connected cluster has been established, it will begin to
dissolve smaller clusters and will absorb them as seen in 2, where the
final cluster starts forming from the lower right.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is visible that smaller clusters dissolve and must restructure after
connection with a bigger cluster. This could be avoided in some cases.
Further research must show whether a new Cluster Id can be distributed
in a way that leaves both clusters intact and joins them together.</p>

each node can choose between many connection partners. This seems
counter intuitive at first because more connection partners should
result in a faster network setup. But it is visible that clusters tend
to reconnect and dissolve often. The dense setup also shows that nodes
do not connect to their nearest neighbours because the RSSI has not been
used in the Cluster Score function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Choosing better parameters should therefore be an important topic of
future research as well.</p>

setups with 200 nodes</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The time it takes to form the network increases approximately linearly
with the number of nodes involved while the number of average connection
losses will top out at about 10. (The maximum number of nodes that were
simulated is 400.) The number of sent CLUSTER_UPDATE packets does also
increase linearly with the size of the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can possibly be improved by buffering and sending less packets if
they are only used to report an increased cluster size.</p>

<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/img/self-healing2.png" alt="selfhealing"></span> <em>Figure: Self-healing process
(left to right)</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The algorithm provides self-healing capabilities. Once a node is removed
(seen in the second picture of 5), the nodes to the left will rearrange
to join the cluster through a different route. If this previously
removed node is switched on again it will be reconnected to the cluster,
but only as a leaf node and not as an integral part of the network. This
results in separation of failing nodes from the core of the network and
therefore enhances the stability during its lifetime. Broadcasting a
connection loss metric with the JOIN_ME packets could therefore allow
the algorithm to form more stable networks by rating nodes based on
their connection stability.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_slave_connection_procedure"><a class="anchor" href="#_slave_connection_procedure"></a>Slave Connection Procedure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, a node cannot connect to a smaller cluster because the only
reachable node is already connected by another master and has thus used
up its incoming connection. We must then tell the node to disconnect its
current connection. This can have some side effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/img/slave-connection.png" alt="slaveconnection"></span> <em>Figure: Problematic
connection situation</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When node A broadcasts its JOIN_ME packet, node B must disconnect from
its current cluster. After node B has disconnected, it will start
advertising and node A will try to connect to it. This will fail because
node B is not able to physically reach node A because of its limited
send range. This results in permanent disconnections and battery
depletion and must therefore be solved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One solution is to add an ACK field to the JOIN_ME packet, which can
contain a Node Id. Node A can set this field to the Node Id of node B,
which it will only know if it already received JOIN_ME packets from node
B previously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Node B will then receive this packet and must now disconnect its
connection and advertise its presence so that node A can establish a
connection. This will again result in another problem because its
previous cluster might try to connect again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the current implementation, node B will set the Node Id of node A in
the ACK field of the JOIN_ME packets to signal its preferred connection
partner, but it has to be evaluated whether directed advertising
messages provide better results. Using the slave connection procedure
takes more time because of this challenge and response scheme.</p>

<p>Some of the most common data types are:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>nodeID</strong> has a size of 2 bytes which allows for a theoretical limit

company identifier of the M-Way Solutions GmbH.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>Mesh Identifier</strong> has been selected with a length of two bytes that
shall be used to check if the packet is intended for FruityMesh (0xF0).
This allows for multiple protocols with the same Company Identifier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Network Identifier</strong> allows to have multiple networks in the same
physical space and prevents mix-up of discovery packets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last value that belongs to the custom advertising message header is
the <strong>Message Type</strong>, which allows to send a total of 256 different
messages of which only 4 are currently defined. One of these messages is
the JOIN_ME packet that is explained here as an example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JOIN_ME packet contains all the information that a receiver must
know to decide whether it wants to connect to this node or not. This
includes the Node Id, Cluster Id, Cluster Size and the number of free
connections. Further research must show if additional data should be
integrated in this packet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Write Handle</strong> is used to transmit a GATT handle that the mesh
implementation uses for communication between two connected nodes. In

<h3 id="_event_handling"><a class="anchor" href="#_event_handling"></a>Event Handling</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main function uses an event handling loop that is entered as soon as
the initialization phase is completed. The event handler routine blocks
as soon as there are no more events to process and lets the device sleep
until an event is generated in the SoftDevice. This event handling is
thread save and events will be processed in the order in which they are
generated. An event will be dispatched to different event handlers for
advertising, scanning, services and connections where it is either
pre-processed and then delegated to the C++ classes or completely
handled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because cluster size changes are communicated through increase or
decrease messages, it is important that a node always handles these
messages correctly because a failure to do so will result in
inconsistent data.</p>

<h3 id="_node_states"><a class="anchor" href="#_node_states"></a>Node States</h3>

<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/img/node-states.png" alt="states"></span> <em>Figure: Simplified FruityMesh state
flowchart</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a node is initialized, it enters the DISCOVERY_HIGH state in which
it tries to connect to other clusters as soon as possible. After a
timeout of a few seconds, it changes to the DECISION state where it
decides whether it wants to connect to another cluster. If no other
cluster was found, it sleeps for a few seconds in the BACK_OFF state to
conserve energy. After several loops without finding another cluster, it
will use the DISCOVERY_LOW state instead of DISCOVERY_HIGH. This allows
the node to save more energy by scanning and advertising less and is
important when a node is switched on in places without other nodes or if
the network has been fully discovered. The node will change to the
DISCOVERY_HIGH state again as soon as it receives a packet from a
different cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a smaller cluster has been found, the node attempts to connect to
it (CONNECTING) which is followed by a handshake procedure (HANDSHAKE).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ACK field is updated as part of the Slave Connection Procedure.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_discovery_states"><a class="anchor" href="#_discovery_states"></a>DISCOVERY States</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The DISCOVERY_HIGH and DISCOVERY_LOW state do only differ in the duty
cycles of advertising and scanning operations and the timeouts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In these states, a node alternates advertising and scanning for JOIN_ME
packets. If a packet is received, it is saved to the JOIN_ME buffer with
a timestamp. An older JOIN_ME packet from the same node is always
overwritten in the buffer. Old packets are also replaced when there is
no more space in the JOIN_ME buffer left. No further processing is done
in the DISCOVERY states.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_decision_state"><a class="anchor" href="#_decision_state"></a>DECISION State</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The buffered packets are evaluated with the cluster score function in
order to determine the best connection partner. At first, the node tries
to find a connection partner that can accept an incoming connection. It
will try to connect if one is found. If there are no good candidates
available, it tries to invoke the Slave Connection Procedure that has
been explained previously. If there is a packet in the buffer that
contains its Node Id in the ACK field, it must disconnect its
connections and change to the DISCOVERY_HIGH state again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_back_off_state"><a class="anchor" href="#_back_off_state"></a>BACK_OFF State</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The BACK_OFF state helps to reduce energy consumption. It has a random
timeout that prevents nodes from simultaneously entering the state
multiple times. This would prevent nodes from discovering each other.</p>

<h3 id="_connections"><a class="anchor" href="#_connections"></a>Connections</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the ATT protocol is not the best fit for managing data streams it
can be made to work in such a way. This has been done by implementing a
mesh Service with a single Characteristic that is used to transfer data.
Both connected devices are allowed to send Write Commands/Requests which
trigger an event handler on the receiving side. This enables a
bidirectional connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because every device knows the Node Id of its connection partners, it is
possible to implement a GATT bridge. This would allow us to exploit the
strength of the GATT protocol and use all of its features over the mesh.
With a GATT bridge, it is also possible to query existing BLE devices
over the mesh that are not capable to work in a mesh. This is a key
feature that should be implemented in a future version.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_handshake"><a class="anchor" href="#_handshake"></a>Handshake</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After discovering the handles, the mesh has to perform a handshake
during which both nodes send their current cluster information
(CLUSTER_WELCOME). The connection is only set active after this
handshake has finished and is not used to relay any data in the
meantime.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_active_connection"><a class="anchor" href="#_active_connection"></a>Active Connection</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An active connection can receive data packets and relay them to other
nodes. A message is relayed to all connections if the destination Node
Id is set to 0, which signifies a broadcast packet. There are multiple
types of possible messages. CLUSTER_INFO_UPDATE messages are used to
transmit the latest cluster size and id. Other important messages have
their own type while user-messages should be encapsulated within Module
messages.</p>

<h2 id="_further_ideas"><a class="anchor" href="#_further_ideas"></a>Further Ideas</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By using <strong>data aggregation</strong>, it is possible to combine multiple packets
in one packet. This reduces the overhead of the protocol and can be used
to save energy. Advanced algorithms for data compression and filtering
can be used as well. But these can all be implemented on top of the
protocol without altering its functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Cluster Score function can be altered to take several aspects into
account. For example broadcasting <strong>the remaining battery resources in
the JOIN_ME packet</strong> will result in a network that is first built with
devices with extended power supplies. After the core network has been
built, it will be joined by the remaining devices with less battery
capacity. These will have to manage a lower number of links and data
packets. It is also preferable to <strong>include the Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI)</strong> in this packetin combination with a <strong>dynamically
configured TX</strong> powerin order to achieve stable links that need less
transmission power and have a higher robustness against interference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Smartphones and other moving devices should broadcast a <strong>mobile-flag</strong> in
their discovery packets in order to be excluded from the network&#8217;s core.
It is better to add moving devices as edges to the network tree so that
the network does not need to constantly reform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connection <strong>timeouts</strong> must be chosen in a way that
connection loss is only encountered sparsely to prevent the network from
reconfiguring. The timeout should depend on the environment in terms of
interference and physical facts and on the speed at which the network
must react to changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connection properties like Slave Latency and Connection Interval can be
handled between two nodes independently from the network. If both are
connected to power they can agree on a small connection interval. This
would reduce the hop latency and improve overall network performance.
Another improvement that is currently not implemented would require
nodes to use a low connection interval for fast network setup and scale
down afterwards in order to shorten the discovery time.</p>
