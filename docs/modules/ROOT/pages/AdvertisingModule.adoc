== Advertising Module (moduleId 1)
==== Purpose
This module allows the user to configure a number of advertising messages  that are sent periodically. It is possible to send iBeacon messages, EddyStone messages and other custom advertising messages without having to update the firmware. Using FruityMesh in conjunction with a MeshGateway, we can have a fully managed beacon infrastructure.

TIP: The AdvertisingModule is only intended for beaconing messages that can then be configured over the mesh. Take a look at the  <<AdvertisingController.adoc#,AdvertisingController>> documentation for how to schedule advertising messages in your implementation.

==== Functionality
The AdvertisingModule is currently configured by setting its persistent configuration. At the moment, it allows one message to be broadcasted at a time and does not cycle through different messages. Message cycling can however be easily implemented as the mesh framework already supports this.

==== Usage
Load a new configuration for *nodeId 45* with the following values:

* *moduleActive:* true
* *advertisingInterval:* 100 ms
* *advertising message type:* iBeacon
* *UUID:* AABBCCDD-EEFF-0011-2233-445566778899
* *major:* 1
* *minor:* 2
* *calibratedRSSI:* -60
