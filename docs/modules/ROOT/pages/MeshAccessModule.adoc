= MeshAccessModule (moduleId 10)

== Purpose 

The MeshAccessModule provides a simple way of accessing the mesh through a Smartphone, it also provides
a way to connect to other meshes or access other devices that support
the functionality. It works over unencrypted GAP connections and uses a
custom encryption on top to bypass operating system limitations of
different devices.

== Functionality 
The MeshAccessModule works in conjunction with the MeshAccessConnection. The module provides the necessary services while
the connection handles an individual connection after it was set up.

The MeshAccessConnection is able to handle standard mesh packets -
including packet splitting - and will relay these packets to receivers
in the mesh if security permits it (if the partner authenticated itself
with the correct key during the initial encryption procedure).

There are different types of connection keys used to authenticate when
connecting with a node. The keyId is then sent through the mesh
depending on the packet type to authenticate the user over the mesh.

If parts of the documentation are obscure, it is advisable to take a
look at the thoroughly documented relution/fruitymesh repository at the
classes MeshAccessConnection.cpp and MeshAccessModule.cpp

=== Connection Keys
For the different key types used, refer to the
encryption types in the
<<Specification.adoc#EncryptionKeys,Specification>>.

=== Virtual Partner
Ids Because mesh packets need a sender and receiver
id, it would not be possible to connect to another mesh as the nodeIds
might clash. When a node connects to another device using a
MeshAccessConnection, it will assign a virtualPartnerId to the other
device, which is unique in the mesh. This partnerId is temporary (only
while the connection lasts) and can be used to address the device during
its connection.

The device does not get to know this virtual id and can operate with its
own nodeId while using the connection. The node with modify received
packets and will replace the devices id by the temporary id. It will
also inspect packets before sending them to the other device and will
translate the virtual id back into the id of the device before
transmitting the packet over the MeshAccessConnection.

=== Tunnel Types
A node that connects to another mesh will need to
specify the tunnelType, it can be on of the following:

* MESH_ACCESS_TUNNEL_TYPE_PEER_TO_PEER = 0: The two nodes can
communicate directly, but broadcast messages will not be relayed to the
mesh on either side.
* MESH_ACCESS_TUNNEL_TYPE_REMOTE_MESH = 1: We can address each node in
the remote mesh from the local node, but cannot relay packets from the
remote mesh to our mesh.
* MESH_ACCESS_TUNNEL_TYPE_LOCAL_MESH = 2: All nodes from our mesh can
send and receive data to/from the node but we cannot send data to the
remote mesh.

=== Authorization 
Depending on the key type, certain messages are not
allowed to be sent through a MeshAccessConnection. The key type can be
any of the <<Specification.adoc#EncryptionKeys,EncryptionKeys>>.
The MeshAccessConnection will pass on an incoming message to all modules
that can then decide if they either want to whitelist or blacklist a
message. Only allowing the message to be sent to the local node is also
possible. Blacklisting always has preference over whitelisting. If a
message got blacklisted by a module, it cannot get whitelisted by
another module.

=== MeshAccess Broadcast Messages 
The Mesh Configuration and Access
Service is broadcasted by active nodes that provide Mesh Access to
Smartphones or other devices through GATT.

The enrollment state is broadcasted in the flags. If unenrolled, the
node service is disabled.

=== GATT Service 
The MeshAccess Service is offered under a different
UUID (a 128 bit UUID) in order to seperate different services from each
other.

* Base Service UUID 00000001-ACCE-423C-93FD-0C07A0051858
* RX Characteristic Handle: 00000002-ACCE-423C-93FD-0C07A0051858
* TX Characteristic Handle: 00000003-ACCE-423C-93FD-0C07A0051858

After a connection is made, it is necessary to register notifications on
the TX characteristic in order to receive data from the node. Do not
send any data before notifications are enabled!

=== Encryption Handshake 
To establish a connection, the following has to
be done:

* Central connects to peripheral
* Central discovers the MeshAccessService of the peripheral with its
rx/tx characteristics and the cccd of the tx characteristic
* Central enables notifications on cccd of tx characteristic
** The peripheral will notice the enabled notification and will
instantiate a MeshAccessConnection throught the ResolverConnections
* Central starts handshake by requesting a nonce
* Peripheral anwers with ANonce
* Central answers with SNonce in an encrypted packet (enables auto
encrypt/decrypt)
* Peripheral checks encrypted packet, sends encrypted HandshakeDone
packet and enables auto encrypt/decrypt

Encryption and MIC calculation uses three AES encryptions at the moment
to prevent a discovered packet forgery attack under certain conditions.
Future versions of the handshake may employ different encryption.

=== Encryption Once a connection is set to encrypted state - during the
initial encryption handshake - then all messages must be encrypted with
a trailing Message Integrity Check (MIC). The data will have the
following format:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Bytes |Type |Name |Description
|1...16 |u8[] |encryptedData |Encrypted data that must be decrypted
first, using the key determined during the handshake together with the
decryptionNonce.

|4 |u32 |mic |Message integrity check that protects the message against
forgery or replay attacks. added at the end of the variable sized
encryptedData field.
|===

Because an encrypted packet has only 16 bytes of payload, message
splitting must account for this. A connection with an MTU of 20 will at
first split packets into chunks of 20 bytes (2 byte splitting overhead +
18 byte content). After encryption is activated, the chunks have a size
of 16 bytes.

* Encryption is done by generating a keystream with the
encryptionNonce. A 16 byte plaintext is created with 0x00 padding and
the encryptionNonce is copied into the first 8 bytes. This plaintext is
encrypted using the sessionEncryptionKey to produce a keystream.
* Next, data to be sent is xored with the keystream. The data can be
anything from 1 to 16 bytes long.
* The last 4 byte of the encryptionNonce (encryptionNonce[1]) is used
as a counter and is now incremented.
* A new keystream is generated with the increased nonce as explained
above.
* This keystream is again xored with the plaintext data to be sent.
* The resulting ciphertext is encrypted once more. The first 4 bytes can
now be used as a MIC.

If the first message were to be encrypted with a nonce of 1, then the
mic would have been generated with a nonce of 2. The next message to be
sent must by encrypted with a nonce of 3.

=== SessionKey Generation A session Key is generated by creating a 16
byte plaintext message padded with 0x00. The first two bytes (1-2) must
contain the nodeId of the central device. Bytes 3-10 must contain the
nonce. This plaintext is then encrypted using the chosen key. In case
the key is a user key, the key must first be derived from the
userBaseKey. This works by creating a 0x00 padded 16 byte cleartext,
storing the keyId in the first 4 bytes of the message and encrypting the
cleartext with the userBaseKey. The resulting ciphertext is the derived
user key.

== Terminal Commands 
=== Connection Establishment 
Instructs a node to build a MeshAccessConneciton to another node. The connection state will be notified back to the requester.

[source,C++]
----
//Establish a connection to another device using a MeshAccessConnection
//Defaults are keyId=FM_NODE_KEY, keyHex=same as local keys, tunnelType=PEER_TO_PEER, requestHandle=0
action [nodeId] ma connect [bleAddress] {keyId} {keyHex} {tunnelType} {requestHandle}

//E.g. Connect to device 00:11:.. with node key 11:22:...
action this ma connect 00:11:22:33:44:55 1 11:22:33:44:11:22:33:44:11:22:33:44:11:22:33:44
----

=== Connection Disconnection 
Disconnect from a device if is connected
using a MeshAccessConnection on that node.

[source,C++]
----
//Disconnect a previously connected MeshAccessConnection
action [nodeId] ma disconnect [bleAddress] {requestHandle}

//E.g. disconnect device 00:11:... if connected to this node
action this ma disconnect 00:11:22:33:44:55

=== StartHandshake 
The central starts the encrypting process by sending
the following unencrypted packet.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Bytes |Type |Name |Description
|1 |u8 |messageType |MESSAGE_TYPE_ENCRYPT_CUSTOM_START

|2 |u16 |senderId |Either a nodeId in the own mesh, or in case of a
Smartphone, this must be NODE_ID_APP_BASE(32000)

|2 |u16 |receiverId |Set to 0 or if known, the id of the partner

|1 |u8 |version |Set to 1.

|4 |u32 |keyId |Set to the keyId that should be used for this
connection.

|2 bit |u8:2 |tunnelType |Tunnel Type that should be used for this
connection. See TunnelType. The invalid type must not be sent. E.g. if a
Smartphone connects to a mesh, it should use REMOTE_MESH, or if it just
wants to interact with a single node and not with the mesh, it can use
PEER to PEER if it wants.

|6 bit |u8:6 |reserved |
|===

=== HandshakeANonce 
The peripheral will generate a random nonce with a
length of 8 bytes andanswer with an unencrypted packet. The peripheral
can also start to generate the session decryption key at this time (see
SessionKey generation chapter). After sending this packet, the
peripheral will only acceppt encrypted packets from now on.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Bytes |Type |Name |Description
|1 |u8 |messageType |MESSAGE_TYPE_ENCRYPT_CUSTOM_ANONCE
|2 |u16 |senderId |The peripherals nodeId in the mesh.
|2 |u16 |receiverId |Replay of the central id.
|4 |u32 |anonce[0] |The first part of the anonce
|4 |u32 |anonce[1] |Second part of the anonce.
|===

=== HandshakeSNonce 
The central must now generate a random 8 byte
nonce as well. It is then able to calculate both session keys, the key
for encryption and the key for decryption. It will then send the
following packet, but in encrypted form. The anonce is used to generate
the session encryption key for sending packets and the snonce is used
to calculate the session decryption key for receiving packets.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Bytes |Type |Name |Description
|1 |u8 |messageType |MESSAGE_TYPE_ENCRYPT_CUSTOM_SNONCE
|2 |u16 |senderId |senderId
|2 |u16 |receiverId |receiverId
|4 |u32 |snonce[0] |The first part of the snonce
|4 |u32 |snonce[1] |Second part of the snonce.
|===

=== HandshakeDone 
The peripheral will answer with the final handshake
packet to state that the handshake was completed successfully. This
packet is of course transmitted encrypted

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
