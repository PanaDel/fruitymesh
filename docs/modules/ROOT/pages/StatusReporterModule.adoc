= StatusReporterModule (moduleId 3)

== Purpose 
This module should report the node's
status according to a configured interval. Furthermore, it provides
methods for directly requesting different kinds of device info, status,
etc,... data.

== Functionality 
The StatusReporterModule can periodically send out
different kinds of information messages. It will also feed the watchdog
once keep alive messages are received. It is responsible for sending out
logged error codes and for measuring the necessary data for its messages
such as the battery power.

== Terminal Commands 
=== Device Information 
Generic information about a
node that does not change or very seldomly - only through enrollment or
firmware update, can be requested via the get_device_info command.

[source,C++]
----
//Request the full device info from some nodes
action [nodeId] status get_device_info
----

=== Status Information 
Information that is bound to change from time to
time can be requested using the get_status command.

[source,C++]
----
//Request the status
action [nodeId] status get_status
----

=== Connection Information 
Information about the mesh connections of a
node can be requested with the following command.

[source,C++]
----
//Retrieve the connections from all nodes in the network
action [nodeId] status get_connections
----

[source,C++]
----
//Return nearby nodes from the JOIN_ME buffer
action [nodeId] status get_nearby
----

=== Livereports 
Livereports are a way to send information about errors,
connections, disconnecttions and other important events to the user
through the mesh. Each livereport has a unique id according to its
importance. Setting the livereport level to a level greater than 0 will
activate the reporting. The different levels are:

* Off (0)
* Error (50)
* Warn (100)
* Info (150)
* Debug (200)

[source,C++]
----
//Set the livereport level
action [nodeId] status livereports [liveReportLevel]

//Activate livereports for all errors on all nodes
action 0 status livereports 50

=== Live Reports
The statusReporterModule can send live reports that
notify the user over various state changes and error conditions. A live
Report is generated on a node and is then broadcasted over the mesh.
This allows us to do live debugging of mesh errors, e.g. if two nodes
are not connecting to each other. Live Reports are also received over
MeshAccessConnections which means we can find an error after we connect
to the disconnected part of the mesh using a MeshAccessConnection.
