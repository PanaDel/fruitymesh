= CherrySim

____
CherrySim is not yet open source. We are working on it, stay tuned for
updates.
____

CherrySim is our new simulator that is based on our FruityMesh code. It is written entierly in C and C++. You will notice a few `#ifdef` statements in the FruityMesh codebase which check if the simulator is enabled.

== Functionality and Features
Our new simulator abstracts the SoftDevice and creates a communication layer between the nodes. It simulates all nodes in short timesteps and can even display a visualization of the mesh.

It supports terminal input and output for all nodes, pipe communication for exchanging data efficiently with other applications, pseudo randomness to deterministically debug a problem, battery usage estimation, google test integration, random configurations or user defined positions, etc,...

We use our simulator a lot for:
- Unit and System Testing
- Estimating battery usage
- Implementing new features
- Evaluating and improving mesh behaviour
- Debugging implementation problems
