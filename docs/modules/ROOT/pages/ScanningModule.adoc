= ScanningModule (moduleId 2)

== Purpose
The Scanning module should be configurable with a number of filters that allow it to scan for advertising messages from other devices in the future. These could be Smartphones or other BLE devices. Once such a message is scanned, it is processed and reported according to the filter rules which could be: Count the total number of scanned messages, report any found message, ...

At the moment, the ScanningModule looks for assetTracking messages that are sent out by our Assets. The ScanningModule will be refactored in the future to be more generic.

TIP: The ScanningModule is not intended for receiving custom advertising messages. Implement the BleEventHandler in your custom module to process the messages yourself. See <<Modules.adoc#,Modules>> and <<ScanController.adoc#,ScanController>> documentation.
