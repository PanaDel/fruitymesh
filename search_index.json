Module FAQ bluerange-firmware master bluerange-firmware master bluerange-firmware AdvertisingController The AdvertisingController should be used for registering custom advertising messages. Advertising jobs can be added and removed and have a number of slots according to their importance. The AdvertisingController will then schedule all registered advertising messages so that they cannot interfer with the messages from other modules. Advertising messages can either be scheduled or immediate. A scheduled message will be send randomly according to the number of slots interleaved with all other registered advertising messages. An immediate message will stop all other advertising and will send the message for the number of slots given. The job will then be removed automatically. The advertising controller will automatically use the lowest advertising interval from all registered messages. If there are two registered advertising messages, each with 5 slots, they will be distributed evenly, each 5 out of a sum of 10 slots. Once another job with 5 slots is registered, each message is sent 1/3 of the time. The AdvertisingController will also make sure that advertising is restarted once a connection to another device is made.

It is possible to send iBeacon messages, EddyStone messages and other custom advertising messages without having to update the firmware. Using FruityMesh in conjunction with a MeshGateway, we can have a fully managed beacon infrastructure. The AdvertisingModule is only intended for beaconing messages that can then be configured over the mesh. Take a look at the AdvertisingController documentation for how to schedule advertising messages in your implementation. The AdvertisingModule is currently configured by setting its persistent configuration. At the moment, it allows one message to be broadcasted at a time and does not cycle through different messages.

Simple, isn’t it? Well, not too simple. There are tons of settings that affect the performance of FruityMesh and some use-cases will require different settings for some of these parameters. Many of these settings have been benchmarked with the current implementation. Measurements were done with the nRF51 DK with chip version QFACA1. The system consumption for many of these cases are detailed in this document. The same test applications on a nRF52 consume a little less energy. Doing nothing will still cost some energy because the RAM and the low frequency clock must be running at all times. This costs about 5.6µA on average. But because the mesh implementation needs some timers, different timer intervals have been tested: Every 1000ms: 6.3µA Every 500ms: 7µA Every 100ms: 11.5µA The Sleep Power mode should be set to NRF_POWER_MODE_LOWPWR which is the default because constant latency will consume 1mA on average. The DC/DC converter should be enabled to save 10-20% during radio activity. All further measurements have been made with a 500ms timer enabled. Different Advertising intervals will result in a very different power consumption. These values have been measured with DC/DC enabled and advertising on all three channels: Advertising every 25ms will consume 770µA Advertising every 100ms will reduce the system consumption to 222µA This does mostly scale linearly. There’s nothing like scanning when it comes to draining the battery as quickly as possible, even with DC/DC on: Scanning at 50% duty cycle: 5.4mA Scanning at 100% duty cycle: 10.8mA Again, we can see that this scales nicely. Next up, we tested the BLE connections with the DC/DC on, both as a Master and as a Slave: 1 Connection with an interval of 100ms: 77µA (empty PDUs), 134µA (20 byte each connection event) 2 Connections with 100ms each: 142µA (empty PDUs) 3 Connections: 211µA The differences between a Slave and a Master connection were not directly measurable because of the good sleep clocks but the Slave will probably use a bit more energy because it has to synchronize on the Master at each connection event. A connection at 30ms used 230µA with empty data packets and 270µA with 20 byte payloads. This suggests that each connection adds a rather constant amount of energy consumption and having three connections at 100ms instead of only one will consume a little less than three times the amount of a single connections. Measuring mesh discovery consumption is a little tricky because of the SoftDevice scheduling. Sometimes discovery will use less energy while the device has a connection in contrast to a device without connections because the different tasks (scanning/advertising/connection events/…​) will collide. Some important measurements were carried out to evaluate the tradeoff between fast connection and low power measurement of mesh. 100ms advertising on all channels 40ms scan interval 20ms scan window 3s in DISCOVERY state 1s + 1 random second in BACK_OFF state ⇒ 2.2mA with one connection and 2.6 mA without a connection 200ms advertising on all channels 1000ms scan interval 20ms scan window 3s in DISCOVERY state 1s + 1 random second in BACK_OFF state ⇒ 240µA with one connection and 200µA without a connection 1000ms advertising on all channels 2000ms scan interval 10ms scan window 8s in DISCOVERY state 5s + 5 random second in BACK_OFF state ⇒ 110µA with one connection and 60µA without a connection Battery measurement were calculated for prod_mesh_nrf52 featureset. Measurement for both High and Low discovery are as follows: Consumes on average 890 uA when in mesh. Consumes on average 760 uA when not in mesh. Scan 50-55 packets of all the nearby nodes every 30 sec. Scan 10-12 joinMe packets every 30 sec from a single device advertising at interval 100ms. time to connect to other node = 100 ms - 400 ms. Consumes on average 460 uA when in mesh. Consumes on average 220 uA when not in mesh. Scan 15-20 packets from all the nearby nodes every 30 sec. Scan 1-2 joinMe packets every 30 sec from a single device advertising at interval 200ms. time to connect to other node = 700 ms - 30 s. By selecting the appropriate parameters for discovery, we can balance between fast connection vs. energy consumption. In general, discovery should be switched off after all devices have joined the network. Once a device loses a connection, discovery should be switched on again. There are different possibilities to achieve this. The best possibility is having a MeshGateway that monitors the mesh and switches discovery on or off. But if the clusterSize of the mesh is known, it is possible to switch discovery off or to a very low setting once the target cluster size is reached. Additionally, a timeout has to be implemented to switch discovery to a low setting after some time in case a node is defective and the target cluster size is never reached. Under good conditions, connections should not break up often which means that discovery can be off at most times. While everything is connected, every node will need about 150-250µA at a connection interval of 100ms. If you do not need low latency, you can easily set the connection interval to a very low 4000ms. This should give you a power consumption as low as 20µA once discovery is switched off. We have not yet done many tests which intervals provide the best balance between power consumption and performance. Be aware that tweaking some parameters might result in the mesh not connecting properly. We are still working on optimizing the power consumption for most general use-cases.

We are working on it, stay tuned for updates. CherrySim is our new simulator that is based on our FruityMesh code. It is written entierly in C and C++. You will notice a few #ifdef statements in the FruityMesh codebase which check if the simulator is enabled. Our new simulator abstracts the SoftDevice and creates a communication layer between the nodes. It simulates all nodes in short timesteps and can even display a visualization of the mesh. It supports terminal input and output for all nodes, pipe communication for exchanging data efficiently with other applications, pseudo randomness to deterministically debug a problem, battery usage estimation, google test integration, random configurations or user defined positions, etc,…​ We use our simulator a lot for: - Unit and System Testing - Estimating battery usage - Implementing new features - Evaluating and improving mesh behaviour - Debugging implementation problems CherrySim has only one instance that is supposed to simulate many instances of FruityMesh. Hence FruityMesh must be written in a way, that code itself has no state variables. No global or function static variables are allowed. Every variable that needs to be saved from function call to another needs to be a part of class as instances of classes in CherrySim are created for every node.

It will just call two functions from FruityMesh.cpp where the first will boot the node and the second will run an endless loop to fetch and process events. During bootup, the SoftDevice, Terminal, Logger, Storage, and other classes are initialized. The event handling routine will take over after everything has been started. All event dispatching routines and interrupt or error handlers are implemented here. The base folder contains a few classes that are meant as wrappers to the S130 API. The most central being the FruityHal which wraps all nRF functionality (not yet complete). The Node class is responsible for building mesh connections and works hand in hand with the MeshConnection and ConnectionManager classes to accomplish its tasks. The ConnectionManager is responsible for handling and scheduling all BLE connections. It handles connects, disconnects and reestablishing as a central point. All connections between nodes are using the MeshConnection class. This, together with the ConnectionManager and the Node, handles clustering and meshing in general. Other classes, all derived from BaseConnection are also in this folder and they enable Smartphones for example to connect to the mesh and send and receive data. The most important one is the MeshAccessConnection which implements a custom encryption protocol for communicating with external devices independant from their operating system. This folder contains a number of modules that provide specific functionality apart from the meshing protocol. If you want to implement a new Module, you should take the template from the fruitymesh/src_examples/ folder to get started and have a look at the StatusReporterModule to get an idea of how to implement additional functionality.

They store important information for clustering such as the clusterId and clusterSize of their partner.

The debug module does not perform a lot of functionality itself, but will mainly trigger actions from other moduels for debug purpose. It does however have a flooding mode implemented. Sometimes it is necessary to reset all nodes connected to a mesh at once. This is where the reset command comes in handy. After receiving the command, each node will wait a predefined time (about 10 seconds) that can be optionally modified. This ensures that the packet is sent to other nodes as well before resetting. //Receiving nodes will reset within a few seconds action [nodeId] debug reset {waitSeconds} To debug problems with discovery, we might want to get the JOIN_ME buffer from all nodes in a mesh. //Receiving nodes will send back their buffer contents action [nodeId] debug get_buffer To find out the latency, we might want to ping some nodes. This command will only give usable results if one node is pinged at a time. It will not keep track of timings when pinging multiple nodes at once. Mode can be unreliable (write_cmd) or reliable (write_req). //Sends a ping to a node and logs the time action [nodeId] debug ping [count] [mode = r / u] //Sends one ping message to nodeId 2 using write_cmd (unreliable) action 2 debug ping 1 u We can have a ping packet bounce multiple times between two nodes to get a better average of the ping. //Bounces a ping back and forth multiple times action [nodeId] debug pingpong [count] [mode] //Bounces a packet back and forth 10 times between the current node and node 45 action 45 debug pingpong 10 u The leaf ping will send a ping command through the mesh starting from the current node. All leaf nodes will respond and the ping times will be logged on the terminal. //Start the leaf ping lping [count] [mode = r / u] The DebugModule has a flooding mode where it will generate messages every once in a while. This is helpful for generating load on the network. Supported modes are: - Off (0): No flooding and no listening - Unreliable (2): Floods with WRITE_CMD packets - Listen (3): Listens for floods from given node and counts them - SplitData (4): Sends big messages that are split into multiple packets //Activates a flooding mode to generate packets action [nodeID] debug flood [destinationNodeId] [mode] [packetsPer100Sec] //E.g. Tells node 1 to flood node 2 with 1 packet each second action 1 debug flood 2 2 100 //E.g. instructs node 2 to count packets from node 1 action 2 debug flood 1 3 0 It is possible to store, retrieve or delete a record by using the terminal on the local node.

The Stacked Program Counter (PC before e.g. the hardfaultHandler was called) will be saved in stacktrace[0]. Using this information we should be able to get the source code line where the error happened. Use the following: \\bin\\arm-none-eabi-addr2line -e \\_build\\debug\\NRF51_BOARD\\FruityMesh.out 0x35BA5 The address must be given as a hex value, otherwise, addr2line will print no valid result!! FruityMesh must have been compiled with debug information using -g In order to analyze a broken node, the flash and UICR can be read back in order to analyze the problem. A good idea is to read back UICR and flash and afterwards compare the .hex with either the last .hex flashed onto this beacon (from the fruitydeploy beacon directory) or flash the beacon again and read it back. Read back code and UICR to a .hex file: nrfjprog --readuicr --readcode E:\\dump.hex Convert both .hex files to a hex dump so we can view them with a standard txt editor: srec_cat C:\\test\\dump.hex -intel -o C:\\test\\dump.txt -hex_dump Afterwards, use The TortoiseDiff Tool to see the differences: Page 0 is the master boot record that should not have been altered The first ~120kb are the softdevice that should not have been altered Afterwards comes the application that should not have changes The free space after the application can be whatever it wants The settings are located 2 pages before the bootloader: 0x3E400 (NRF51) 0x76000 (NRF52) The bootloader is at: #define FRUITYLOAD_ADDRESS 0x3EC00 (NRF51) #define FRUITYLOAD_ADDRESS 0x78000 (NRF52) In order to check the correctness of the settings, we could convert the hex dump of the settings pages to a c array using sublime and load it into the flash of a node in the simulator. Then we can properly debug the startup behaviour. But debugging a real node should also be possible if only the settings are broken. When the nodes are somewhere in the building and one of them is stuck in a hardfault, or another endless loop, debugging is complicated. Here’s how to do it: If the node is connected with its USB cable, put a battery in the node, then unplug the USB cable Take the node to the workstation, while it is running on battery Use two USB cables that are both plugged into the docking station (do not plug one into the laptop and the other in the docking station because they might have a different ground!!!) One of the cables is plugged into the DevKit / Debugger The other cable is plugged into the node ⇒ Debugger and Node are now powered from the same ground level, this is important Next, connect the Debug cable to the node In Eclipse, select the Debug Configuration \"Running Target\". (Connect to running target must be selected and no reset, etc…​ shall be performed) The node should not have restarted during this procedure, …​ hopefully. * == Finding problems in a running System Often, an error only occurs seldomly and in a system that is only remotely accessible. FruityMesh has some inbuilt functionality to find errors in these cases. First, there are live reports (see StatusReporterModule). You could add a number of live report statements to the code and they will be reported through the mesh, as soon as they trigger. The only problem with live reports is, that you might lose them if they always occur if a mesh connection is lost for example. In this case, you can use the error logging facility of the Logger class. This way, the error is logged to ram and can be requested once the node is in the mesh again. The nRF sniffer is used with wireshark. A custom dissector for fruitymesh JOIN_ME packets has been written and is saved in the util/wireshark folder. Integration into wireshark is easy and documented at the beginning of the lua file. The nRF Sniffer does not work with an updated SEGGER Firmware, it is necessary to put the SEGGER Firmeware JLink_V498c on the beacon by using JLinkConfig.exe and replacing selecting replace firmware. Afterwards, the sniffer should work together with the fixed sniffer application received by nordic. If the fixed sniffer application does not find the beacon, open the buggy official version first until the beacon is found, then close and reopen the fixed version.

A Module will receive all events that it is interested in and can save and load its configuration from flash memory. Have a look at Class Structure for some more detailed explanations on how the code is structured. Also keep in mind Instances when implementing new functionalities. There are some utilities in the /util folder, for example a python script that will open a putty terminal for all connected serial devices and a wireshark dissector that can be used together with the nRF Sniffer to inspect the advertising packets. Most settings are found in the fruitymesh/config/ folder in Config.h. Module specific settings are kept within the Module’s header and cpp file. FruityMesh uses so called featuresets for creating different distributions for different use-cases. A featureset defines the compile time and run time configuration for a Node. The make process can be configured differently for a featureset, a number of different defines or macros can be used during compile time and different code is used during runtime. This also allows FruityMesh to run on a number of different boards (different pin settings or configuration) with the same binary. You can specify the featureset by e.g. calling make with make FEATURESET=featureset_name or by creating a Makefile.local FruityMesh does not run on devices with only 16kb of RAM. It might be possible to optimize the build and resize some buffers, but this is currently not supported. The binary of FruityMesh is around 50 kb depending on the configuration and will easily fit on devices with 256 kb flash together with the softdevice and still be updatable using dual bank updates. All kinds of contributions are welcome. Before you start coding, we’d love to talk to you to make sure that we get along nicely in the development process :-) If you have a general question, the best way is to open a new issue and label it with \"question\". This way, we can build up a knowledge base of questions and answers that are easily accessible in the future. If it is a commit-specific comment or question, you can just comment under the commit. We’d love to develop the FruityMesh protocol as an interoperable protocol that works across devices from different developers. If you want to make any changes to the protocol itself, please contact us first so that we can work out a mutual agreement. Every implementation that is compatible with the current official release of FruityMesh is welcome to use the M-Way Solutions Company identifier (0x024D) in the manufacturer specific data along with the current mesh identifier. Be sure to read the Specification for some basics. That is only very basic documentation, we will try to continually improve the specification and add more details. In the meantime, do not hesitate to contact us or have a look in the implementation. The implementation has been written in C++ because this makes it easy to implement new functionality and seperate it from other parts in a clean way. Refactoring or refinement tips are welcome. If you contribute, please comment your code thorougly and keep the implementation as readable as possible. This will help other contributors understand the code quickly. If you have documentation to add, please post a pull request as well. FruityMesh is published under the GPLv3 version which is available in the repository. TODOm Dual licence ?

Not only does our DfuModule allow us to replace FruityMesh, the SoftDevice and the Bootloader, it can also be used to update 3rd party controllers connected via UART / SPI / I2C, etc,…​ In order to update FruityMesh, the DfuModule works in conjunction with our proprietary bootloader. The mesh stays fully functional while an update is received and all services on the mesh can still run during update distribution. Once all nodes have received the update, it will be installed by all nodes in less than a few seconds and the infrastructure will reboot. When updating a 3rd party component, we distribute the update using our standard implementation to all relevant nodes. Afterwards a custom update protocol must be implemented between the FruityMesh controller and the 3rd party controller. We provide our customers with an implementation of the mesh update using our MeshGateway and also an implementation that runs on mobile operating systems.

This means they will not connect to a mesh as long as they are not enrolled. The term enrolled is used in synonym with provisioned or commisioned. In order to assign a node to a mesh, the user has to give a networkId, the networkKey and a unique nodeId for that mesh. This can be done by a MeshGateway or a dedicated enrollment app. The enrollment packet should be sent to the broadcast address 0 and must contain to serial number of the node to be enrolled. The EnrollmentModule supports enrollments over the mesh. A normal enrollment message is sent as a broadcast through the mesh together with the nodeKey of the node that should be enrolled. All the receiving nodes of this message will - at a certain random percentage - try to scan for this node. They will temporarily store the enrollment data and will connect to the node once it was found and enroll it. Also, at a certain random percentage, the node will send an enrollment proposal through the mesh which contains some nearby serial numbers that the MeshGateway might like to enroll. If the message is sent to a specific nodeId, this node will try to scan for the other node with a 100 percent probability. This is useful, if the nodes position is already known, e.g. by parsing an enrollment proposal. The EnrollmentModule support PreEnrollments. A module can register itself using SetPreEnrollmentHandler. The EnrollmentModule will then call this handler once an Unenrollment or Enrollment is received. The Module than has a fixed time to do an enrollment of other components, e.g. an external controller. Once it is done, it must call SaveEnrollment so that the Node enrollment is processed. If this is not called within a defined time, the enrollment will fail with the result code PreEnrollmentFailed. If allowUnenrolledUnsecureConnections is set in the feature set and the node is in an unenrolled state, nodes accept connections with FM_KEY_ID_ZERO for enrollment. This allows an easier enrollment process. NOTE: Such nodes should never be used in an environment where unauthorized people have access because these people also have easy access by design. If the defaultNetworkId (flashed into UICR) is set to 0 and no enrollment configuration is present, the node is unenrolled and the node module is inactive. Enrollment can be done by connecting using a MeshAccessConnection with the node key and sending the enrollment data. If the node was previously enrolled into a different network, the user might not have access to this network. The node module will be active and will search for other nodes in the same network. It is still possible to connect by using a MeshAccessConnection and send a different enrollment to the node. If the defaultNetworkId is set to 1 or any other id known by the MeshGateway, we can send a new enrollment through this enrollment network and the node will pick it up and will reboot into the new network. The data stored in the UICR defines the default enrollment of a node. If a node is by default assigned to networkId 0, it will not do meshing until it is enrolled. If a node is assigned another networkId and networkKey as default, it will try to connect to that mesh after it was flashed. Resetting the node will revert back to these defaults. //Enroll a node action [nodeId] enroll basic [serialNumber] [newNodeId] [newNetworkId] {newNetworkKey} {newUserBaseKey} {newOrganizationKey} {nodeKey} {timeoutSec} {enrollOnlyIfUnenrolled} {requestHandle} //Enroll BBBBB into network 7 that already has nodes 1 and 2 //Node must be connected to terminal or connected to the node with the terminal (e.g. by using a MeshAccessConnection) action 0 enroll basic BBBBB 3 7 78:56:34:12:78:56:34:12:78:56:34:12:78:56:34:12 //Enroll node BBBBB into network 5 over the mesh with new node id 2 //networkKey will be 11:..., userBaseKey 22:..., orgaKey: 33:... //nodeKey is given so that enrollment over mesh can connect securely to the node action 0 enroll basic BBBBB 2 5 11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11 22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22 33:33:33:33:33:33:33:33:33:33:33:33:33:33:33:33 73:63:92:12:63:94:30:44:63:67:23:11:90:11:42:52 10 0 Removing an enrollment from a node will reset all settings to default (factory reset).

You can find all user questions on this page: FruityMesh Questions The answer is: Not easily. FruityMesh has been developed on the Nordic nRF Series. This includes the nRF51422, nRF51822, nRF52832 and nRF52840. It needs the S130 SoftDevice (Supported on IC revision >= 3), S132 or S140 which provides a Bluetooth Low Energy stack that supports concurrent operations as Peripheral/Central/Advertiser and Observer. Connection and disconnection are managed by the FruityMesh algorithm but having concurrent operations is the key to this technology because it consumes less power than advertising and scanning. A lot of the nRF specific functionality has already been extracted into a hardware abstraction layer (FruityHal) but more work is necessary to fully decouple the implementation from the underlying stack. Implementing FruityMesh for a different chipset might be little or a lot of work depending on the capabilities and manner of operation of the other chip. FruityMesh is based on BLE connections instead of broadcasting and advertising. Some of the advantages of this approach are: - There are 37 connection channels and only 3 advertising channels which means that packets are delivered with less effort and with less collisions. - In contrast to a broadcasting mesh, connections can be active at all times while still using less energy than advertising and scanning at times. - This makes it possible to run on batteries and still have a high throughput and low latency. One of the drawbacks is, that setting up connections takes time and a node failure can lead to a temporary loss of connectivity for parts of the mesh.

AssetModule.adoc broadcasting of asset telemetry messages that can be located indoors by our infrastructure. We have already implemented a number of Custom modules and customization of FruityMesh for many of our customers. Coming soon to GitHub: Our CherrySim - written in C++ - simulates the mesh using the FruityMesh code and allows us to implement unit and system tests. During clustering, a new node will do a handshake with its partner node, where they exchange information about the network structure. This includes the cluster size and also the master bit that is used to determine which cluster must dissolve if a connection is lost. Also included in this handshake is the number of hops to the sink (MeshGateway). This information is also included in clusterInfoUpdate packets which notify all nodes about changes in the network. If a sink is available through a connection, the number of hops to that sink will be sent with these packets. The sink itself has 0 hops to the sink. If there is no sink available, it is denoted with -1. The hardware watchdog is configured to restart a node after a certain time if it does not receive a keep alive packet from the gateway in the meantime. This is the last fallback to recover a node if there is some critical unknown issue. This issue will then be reported as a watchdog reboot using the error log of a node. It is possible to configure the watchdog to use safe boot. In safe boot mode, the node will boot up without loading any persistant configuration. This will also mean that the node will not be enrolled in this mode, but it will reboot again in normal mode after the watchdog triggers again. This makes it possible to rescue a node that received a faulty persistent configuration. Each node can store a number of errors in ram. The timestamp, error code and some extra information can be stored. This log can be queried every few minutes or hours. The errors have different significance and some information is logged using a counter that always increments. This statistical information can be used to determine the health of a live mesh and to monitor it. Storing the errors is necessary as they might be generated while a node is disconnected from the mesh. The error log will be cleared once the errors have been queried. Additionally, live error logging can be used to send information about errors through the mesh instantly. This will of course only work if the node is part of the mesh.

We’ll implement a PingModule that allows us to ping a node and get its response. You’d normally implement ping functionality into the StatusReporter oder DebugModule, which is where it belongs, but the use-case acts as a good and easy example for building your own module. You can find the finished files in the folder src/examples or you can just follow the tutorial. Modules are used to structure functionality that does not directly interfer with the mesh-logic. Modules extend the Module class. Each module has the possibility to save a persistent configuration. It can be loaded or unloaded and it is possible to decide which modules are part of the firmware during compile time. A module can choose to register an UART listener and react on commands, it can also output to UART for logging or communication purposes. It can also send data packets through the mesh and receive data. Here is an overview over some of the handlers that it can use: ConfigurationLoadedHandler: Is called when a new Module configuration is loaded TimerEventHandler: Is called at a fixed interval to do periodic tasks BleEventHandler: Routes all Bluetooth Low Energy events to the module MeshMessageReceivedEventHandler: Delivers data that has been sent over the mesh TerminalCommandHandler: Gets called when data is received over UART I will now guide you through the steps to implement a simple module that can ping another node over the network and parse the response. First, clone the TemplateModule.cpp file from the src/examples folder into src/modules/PingModule.cpp, afterwards, do the same with TemplateModule.h but put it in the inc/ folder. You must of course refactor the Method names and some more variales, just use the search function and look out for the string \"template\" anywhere in those two files and rename them accordingly. Activate your module by instantiating it in the constructor of src/FruityMesh.cpp right where all the other modules are instantiated. You might have to increase the MAX_MODULE_COUNT in config/Config.h. Your PingModule Constructor needs a moduleID for instantiation. All module Ids are specified in the Config.h (enum moduleID) as well. You should add a new enum entry under the section \"Custom modules\", e.g. PING_MODULE_ID=200. For example initialization can look like this: activeModules[15] = new PingModule(); You should also include the new . Once the modules .cpp file is in the modules folder, it will automatically be included in the compilation. Now go ahead and try to compile the binary and flash it to a device. Connect via terminal and input get_modules this. You should now see a list of modules and your new Ping modules id should be part of it. It does not do much yet, but we’ll now start to add more functionality. Your PingModule does already overwrite a few of the methods in its base-class. One of these is the TerminalCommandHandler. We’ll keep it simple for this tutorial and we’ll only implement the ping command so that it can be triggered via a locally connected terminal. (It would also be possible to trigger a remote node to send a ping and communicate the result back to another node). In the TerminalCommandHandler, add the following lines to the beginning of the function: if(TERMARGS(0, \"pingmod\")){ //Get the id of the target node nodeID targetNodeId = atoi(commandArgs[0]); logt(\"PINGMOD\", \"Trying to ping node %u\", targetNodeId); //TODO: Send ping packet to that node return true; } The command name and command arguments should be in lowercase letters to be consistent with other commands. You must include so that the atoi method works. Next, flash it to your device again and watch if it reacts on your pingmod command. If it does not, make sure you are using the logtag \"PINGMOD\" and you either enable it by writing debug pingmod in the terminal first, or you enable the logtag by default in FruityMesh.cpp. Now that the module is reacting to our command, we want to send our ping packet. Because this is going to be a very simple message, we will use a predefined message format called connPacketModule. This packet is intended to be used for triggering actions and for responding to these triggers. It has a special message header that contains the moduleId and an actionType. This will ensure that they do not interfere with mesh messages or messages from other modules. To keep our module messages organized, we’ll add an enum that contains all of our messages in the private: section of our PingModule.h file: enum PingModuleTriggerActionMessages{ TRIGGER_PING=0 }; Next, we add the code that is responsible for sending this packet to the other node. The previously written code now looks like this: if(TERMARGS(0, \"pingmod\")){ //Get the id of the target node nodeID targetNodeId = atoi(commandArgs[0]); logt(\"PINGMOD\", \"Trying to ping node %u\", targetNodeId); //Some data u8 data[1]; data[0] = 123; //Send ping packet to that node SendModuleActionMessage( MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION, targetNodeId, PingModuleTriggerActionMessages::TRIGGER_PING, 0, data, 1, false ); return true; } This code creates a buffer of 1 byte and fills in some data (123). This data is not necessary for a ping and was only added for illustration purpose. The message is sent as a ModuleMessage with the moduleId automatically added by the SendModuleActionMessage method. The actionType is TRIGGER_PING. The message type `MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION``is used for sending messages that await a response. The ConnectionManager (cm) will handle the transmission of this packet, it will copy the packet to its buffer and queue the packet transmission. It is important to pass the size of payload (1). The last parameter is used to specify that this packet should be transmitted by using BLE-unacknowledged packet transmission (WRITE_CMD). Next, we want to see if the packet arrived at its destination, we’ll need to implement the MeshMessageReceivedEventHandler in our PingModule which looks like this: void PingModule::MeshMessageReceivedHandler(BaseConnection* connection, BaseConnectionSendData* sendData, connPacketHeader* packetHeader) { //Must call superclass for handling Module::MeshMessageReceivedHandler(connection, sendData, packetHeader); //Filter trigger_action messages if(packetHeader->messageType == MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION){ connPacketModule* packet = (connPacketModule*)packetHeader; //Check if our module is meant and we should trigger an action if(packet->moduleId == moduleId){ //It's a ping message if(packet->actionType == PingModuleTriggerActionMessages::TRIGGER_PING){ //Inform the user logt(\"PINGMOD\", \"Ping request received with data: %d\", packet->data[0]); //TODO: Send ping response } } } } In the PingModule.h, you must now also add the definition for this handler or uncomment it. We can now perform a simple test by flashing this new firmware on our development board again. There is a simple trick that allows us to test the functionality with a single node by pinging the node itself: The ConnectionManager will parse the packet and will route it back to the MeshMessageReceived without broadcasting it because the nodeId is the same as its own. As you can see, the packet triggered the appropriate action in the node. With this working, you should now perform a test with two different nodes. Flash both of them, connect with two terminals and watch how the packet is delivered: Now, a proper ping message should, well, …​. pong. That’s why we need a return packet. Go to PingModule.h and add another enum that contains action responses: enum PingModuleActionResponseMessages{ PING_RESPONSE=0 }; Then, go back to your .cpp file and insert this updated code: void PingModule::MeshMessageReceivedHandler(BaseConnection* connection, BaseConnectionSendData* sendData, connPacketHeader* packetHeader) { //Must call superclass for handling Module::MeshMessageReceivedHandler(connection, sendData, packetHeader); //Filter trigger_action messages if(packetHeader->messageType == MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION){ connPacketModule* packet = (connPacketModule*)packetHeader; //Check if our module is meant and we should trigger an action if(packet->moduleId == moduleId){ //It's a ping message if(packet->actionType == PingModuleTriggerActionMessages::TRIGGER_PING){ //Inform the user logt(\"PINGMOD\", \"Ping request received with data: %d\", packet->data[0]); u8 data[2]; data[0] = packet->data[0]; data[1] = 111; //Send ping packet to that node SendModuleActionMessage( MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_ACTION_RESPONSE, packetHeader->sender, PingModuleActionResponseMessages::PING_RESPONSE, 0, data, 2, false ); } } } //Parse Module action_response messages if(packetHeader->messageType == MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_ACTION_RESPONSE){ connPacketModule* packet = (connPacketModule*)packetHeader; //Check if our module is meant and we should trigger an action if(packet->moduleId == moduleId) { //Somebody reported its connections back if(packet->actionType == PingModuleActionResponseMessages::PING_RESPONSE){ logt(\"PINGMOD\", \"Ping came back from %u with data %d, %d\", packet->header.sender, packet->data[0], packet->data[1]); } } } } This code sends a response to the ping request, includes the data that came with the initial request and adds some more data. Also, it adds another condition that checks for the reply to the ping request and prints it out on the terminal. That’s it, you should now be able to ping any node in the mesh network and see its response. The intermediate nodes will automatically route all traffic without having to know what kind of message it is. You would probably want to use a counter with the ping message to generate a handle for a ping. Then, you’d be able to calculate the time that it took for the packet to come back through the mesh. And as I’ve said initially, you would not necessarily want to create new module for pinging other nodes but you’d have that functionality in a core module.

It allows filtering for log tags to make development easy and also offers some functionality to log error codes into ram. The logger can be used for printing log output to the terminal using the logt macro. With the logjson macro, it is possible to log a json for machine to machine communication. This logging can be removed from the compiled firmware by undefining the ENABLE_LOGGING macro or the ENABLE_JSON_LOGGING macro. Another function called trace will log a string without adding additional information such as the time or the place where the log statement was used. The logger also has functionality for logging events to the RAM, e.g. logError or logCustomError. These will record the time and the error code into ram. Using logCustomCount allows you to increase the value each time the method is called. These error codes can be queried using the get_errors command of the StatusReporterModule. Once the error codes have been requested, the error log will be cleared. When you want to enable or disable a specific logTag, you can toggle it with the following command.

It works over unencrypted GAP connections and uses a custom encryption on top to bypass operating system limitations of different devices. The MeshAccessModule works in conjunction with the MeshAccessConnection. The module provides the necessary services while the connection handles an individual connection after it was set up. The MeshAccessConnection is able to handle standard mesh packets - including packet splitting - and will relay these packets to receivers in the mesh if security permits it (if the partner authenticated itself with the correct key during the initial encryption procedure). A MeshAccessConnection will at first perform a security handshake before data can be transmitted. After the handshake passed, a node might transmit information about its cluster and update this information once the cluster changes. See the ClusterInfoUpdate packet for more information. There are different types of connection keys used to authenticate when connecting with a node. The keyId is then sent through the mesh depending on the packet type to authenticate the user over the mesh. If parts of the documentation are obscure, it is advisable to take a look at the thoroughly documented relution/fruitymesh repository at the classes MeshAccessConnection.cpp and MeshAccessModule.cpp For the different key types used, refer to the encryption types in the Specification. Ids Because mesh packets need a sender and receiver id, it would not be possible to connect to another mesh as the nodeIds might clash. When a node connects to another device using a MeshAccessConnection, it will assign a virtualPartnerId to the other device, which is unique in the mesh. This partnerId is temporary (only while the connection lasts) and can be used to address the device during its connection. The device does not get to know this virtual id and can operate with its own nodeId while using the connection. The node with modify received packets and will replace the devices id by the temporary id. It will also inspect packets before sending them to the other device and will translate the virtual id back into the id of the device before transmitting the packet over the MeshAccessConnection. A node that connects to another mesh will need to specify the tunnelType, it can be on of the following: MESH_ACCESS_TUNNEL_TYPE_PEER_TO_PEER = 0: The two nodes can communicate directly, but broadcast messages will not be relayed to the mesh on either side. MESH_ACCESS_TUNNEL_TYPE_REMOTE_MESH = 1: We can address each node in the remote mesh from the local node, but cannot relay packets from the remote mesh to our mesh. MESH_ACCESS_TUNNEL_TYPE_LOCAL_MESH = 2: All nodes from our mesh can send and receive data to/from the node but we cannot send data to the remote mesh. Depending on the key type, certain messages are not allowed to be sent through a MeshAccessConnection. The key type can be any of the EncryptionKeys. The MeshAccessConnection will pass on an incoming message to all modules that can then decide if they either want to whitelist or blacklist a message. Only allowing the message to be sent to the local node is also possible. Blacklisting always has preference over whitelisting. If a message got blacklisted by a module, it cannot get whitelisted by another module. The Mesh Configuration and Access Service is broadcasted by active nodes that provide Mesh Access to Smartphones or other devices through GATT. The enrollment state is broadcasted in the flags. If unenrolled, the node service is disabled.

Do not send any data before notifications are enabled! To establish a connection, the following has to be done: Central connects to peripheral Central discovers the MeshAccessService of the peripheral with its rx/tx characteristics and the cccd of the tx characteristic Central enables notifications on cccd of tx characteristic The peripheral will notice the enabled notification and will instantiate a MeshAccessConnection throught the ResolverConnections Central starts handshake by requesting a nonce Peripheral anwers with ANonce Central answers with SNonce in an encrypted packet (enables auto encrypt/decrypt) Peripheral checks encrypted packet, sends encrypted HandshakeDone packet and enables auto encrypt/decrypt Encryption and MIC calculation uses three AES encryptions at the moment to prevent a discovered packet forgery attack under certain conditions. Future versions of the handshake may employ different encryption. Once a connection is set to encrypted state - during the initial encryption handshake - then all messages must be encrypted with a trailing Message Integrity Check (MIC). The data will have the following format: Bytes Type Name Description 1…​16 u8[] encryptedData Encrypted data that must be decrypted first, using the key determined during the handshake together with the decryptionNonce. 4 u32 mic Message integrity check that protects the message against forgery or replay attacks. added at the end of the variable sized encryptedData field. Because an encrypted packet has only 16 bytes of payload, message splitting must account for this. A connection with an MTU of 20 will at first split packets into chunks of 20 bytes (2 byte splitting overhead 18 byte content). After encryption is activated, the chunks have a size of 16 bytes. Encryption is done by generating a keystream with the encryptionNonce. A 16 byte plaintext is created with 0x00 padding and the encryptionNonce is copied into the first 8 bytes. This plaintext is encrypted using the sessionEncryptionKey to produce a keystream. Next, data to be sent is xored with the keystream. The data can be anything from 1 to 16 bytes long. The last 4 byte of the encryptionNonce (encryptionNonce[1]) is used as a counter and is now incremented. A new keystream is generated with the increased nonce as explained above. This keystream is again xored with the plaintext data to be sent. The resulting ciphertext is encrypted once more. The first 4 bytes can now be used as a MIC. If the first message were to be encrypted with a nonce of 1, then the mic would have been generated with a nonce of 2. The next message to be sent must by encrypted with a nonce of 3. A session Key is generated by creating a 16 byte plaintext message padded with 0x00. The first two bytes (1-2) must contain the nodeId of the central device. Bytes 3-10 must contain the nonce. This plaintext is then encrypted using the chosen key. In case the key is a user key, the key must first be derived from the userBaseKey. This works by creating a 0x00 padded 16 byte cleartext, storing the keyId in the first 4 bytes of the message and encrypting the cleartext with the userBaseKey. The resulting ciphertext is the derived user key. Instructs a node to build a MeshAccessConneciton to another node. The connection state will be notified back to the requester.

There are the core modules which are part of the open source distribution, which deliver standard functionality. Also, there are other modules, some developed by us or by other developers that can provide specific functionality and built on our mesh framework. All modules share a set of commands for loading and retrieving their configuration, for activating and deactivating them and for triggering actions. Each Custom Module should extend the Module class to have a set of methods that it can override. Some of these methods are explained below: Method Description Module Constructor The constructor must only define variables and should not start any functionality. ConfigurationLoadedHandler This handler is called once the module should be initialized. A pointer to the configuration will be given and all initialization should happen in this method. If the module configuration says that the module is inactive, the module should not initialize any functionality. TimerEventHandler Will be called at a fixed interval for all Modules. If functionality should only be executed e.g. each 5 seconds, use the SHOULD_IV_TRIGGER macro in the handler. TerminalCommandHandler Will receive all terminal input that can then be checked against a list of commands to execute. ButtonHandler Called once a button has been pressed and released. MeshMessageReceivedHandler Will be called once a full message has been received over the mesh (e.g. after all message parts were reassembled) BleEventHandler Implement this to receive all other ble events that have not been preprocessed, such as received advertising packets, new connections, e.g. PreEnrollmentHandler Allows a module to e.g. enroll an attached controller before accepting the enrollment. Check the EnrollmentModule for more info. RecordStorageEventHandler When saving a record, this handler is called once the flash access was done. Check the RecordStorage documentation. CheckMeshAccessPacketAuthorization See MeshAccessModule CheckComponentUpdateRequest Implement to ask a 3rd party controller about compatibility with the Dfu. StartComponentUpdate Called once the Dfu image is ready and can be sent to a 3rd party controller. Commands are given with arguments in brackets [arg]. These must be entered by the user. Arguments in curly brackets {arg} are optional. Sends a new module configuration to any node. The resulting binary configuration will be copied to the module-configuration of the specified module. set_config [nodeID | \"this\"] [module-name] [hex-string] {requestHandle} //Set binary configuration for io module set_config 0 io 06:01:01:00:00 0 Prints the configuration of a specific module //Display the current module configuration, shorthand notation is: getconf get_config [nodeID | \"this\"] [module name] //Print the configuration from the current node's advertising module get_config this adv Activates or deactivates a specific module. //Activate or deactivate a module, shorthand notation is: setactive set_active [nodeID | \"this\"] [module name] [on | off] //Examples set_active 0 scan on //activates the scan module set_active 0 adv off //deactivates the advertising module Most module commands are structured in the same way.

It is a mandatory module. It is responsible for clustering and other mesh related tasks and functionalities that are part of FruityMesh. The node keeps track of all MeshConnections and monitors connects and disconnects. It works in conjunction with the MeshConnection and ConnectionManager classes for this. The node is also responsible for broadcasting mesh discovery (JOIN_ME) packets. It will also activate scanning if necessary and monitor the incoming discovery packets of other nodes. It will create new MeshConnections to other nodes if necessary. A state machine is used to toggle between different discovery states. The node only permits one mesh handshake at a certain time. During the handshake, both mesh nodes will exchange information about their clusters and will decide which cluster is the biggest one. The packets used are specified under Clustering Messages. During the handshake, a backup of the current cluster state is made and used throughout the handshake. After the handshake, cluster changes that happened in the meantime are sent to these connections. Updates on the cluster size or structure are also sent to all MeshAccessConnections. There are a number of undocumented commands. These are mostly for debugging and there is no guarantee that they will be available in future builds. On reboot, the firmware sends a JSON to the connected device, giving more information about the reboot. The JSON has the following structure: { \"type\":\"reboot\", \"reason\":3, //Integer, see below \"code1\":17, //Additional information, depending on the reason given. The valid codes are purposefully undocumented, as they are highly subject to change and are mainly intended to help firmware developers. \"stack\":128, //Stack address of the reboot, if available. \"version\":80021 //Version of the firmware. } The reason can have the following values: Code Name Description 0 UNKNOWN The reboot reason is unknown. A typical case where this can happen is when the node lost power and thus was unable to save any valid reason. Note though, that the reason really is unknown and as such could have any other reason as well. 1 HARDFAULT A hardfault occurred on the device. 2 APP_FAULT Some runtime check of the firmware failed, which rebooted the device. 3 SD_FAULT The Softdevice crashed. 4 PIN_RESET The Power Reset Button was pressed. 5 WATCHDOG The Watchdogs were not fed. 6 FROM_OFF_STATE The node previously was turned off and is now turned on. 7 LOCAL_RESET The \"reset\" command was used, without any additional parameters. 8 REMOTE_RESET The \"action NodeId node reset\" command was sent to the node. 9 ENROLLMENT The reboot happened because of an enrollment. 10 PREFERRED_CONNECTIONS The preferred connections were set. 200-255 USER_DEFINED Some user defined reboot reasons. action [nodeId] node discovery [on / off] It might be necessary to switch the node’s state machine into a different discovery state. This can be done through the mesh and can be used by a MeshGateway to turn off discovery once all enrolled nodes are connected. This allows the node to use a very low power consumption if scanning does not have to be active for other tasks. Once the node loses a connection to one of its partners, it will automatically switch discovery on again. Examples //E.g. switch discovery off for all nodes action 0 node discovery off The response acknowledges the receipt of the command. {\"type\":\"set_discovery_result\",\"nodeId\":123,\"module\":0} action [nodeId] node set_preferred_connections [ignored / penalty] {up to eight preferred nodeIDs} Sets the given nodeIDs as preferred connection partners while meshing. Other partners will be either completely ignored or their cluster score gets a heavy penalty. Executing this command without any nodeID disables this feature. After saving the preferred connections, the node reboots after a delay of 10 seconds. The \"ignored / penalty\" parameter determines the behaviour regarding the unpreferred connection partners, meaning any nodeID that is NOT in the thereafter following list. NOTE: For a connection to happen, both connection partners have to set each other as a preferred connection partner. This means that if you want to set the preferred connections of a mesh, you should best start at the leafs of the mesh. WARNING!!! Using this command with the \"ignored\" parameter must be used with caution as using invalid or unreachable nodeIDs results in a state where the mesh can not be created. If this happened to you, you have two options: 1. flash the beacon. This erases the set preferred connections. 2. Connect to the beacon via a mesh access connection and execute the command again with correct parameters. Examples //E.g. Sets the preferred connections of 123 to 17, 32 and 12. Other connections partners are ignored for meshing. action 123 node set_preferred_connections ignored 17 32 12 The response acknowledges the receipt of the command. {\"type\":\"set_preferred_connections_result\",\"nodeId\":123,\"module\":0} // Generate a sensor event and send through mesh // (Only used for debugging) component_sense [nodeId] [moduleId] [actionType] [component] [registerAddress] [dataHex] {requestHandle=0} //E.g. broadcast sensor event for module 123 from component 7 and registerAddress 77 component_sense 0 123 0 7 77 AA:BB Following low-level data structure transports sensor measurement values across the mesh. enum SensorMessageActionType { UNSPECIFIED = 0, // E.g.

The packet header consumes 12 bytes, which allows for 8 bytes of payload in a single packet and should be enough for most sensor values. For bigger payloads, it will be split.

For WRITE and WRITE_ACK, the payload is the bytes that should be written. No json representation is necessary for the moment as the meshgateway will not react on act messages. status It is very conveniant to get easily readable information about a node. The status command displays the currently active connections and their state. It also display device information and the clustering state. The following will be printed on the local terminal after the command was entered: Node BBBBB (nodeId: 1) vers: 80000, NodeKey: 01:00:....:00:00 Mesh clusterSize:10, clusterId:4201185286 Enrolled 1: networkId:10, deviceType:0, NetKey 04:00:....:00:00, UserBaseKey 00:00:....:00:00 Addr:00:00:00:01:00:00, ConnLossCounter:3, AckField:0, State: 1 CONNECTIONS 2 (freeIn:0, freeOut:2, pendingPackets:0 IN (0) FM 7, state:4, cluster:fa690006(8), sink:-1, Queue:0-0(0), Buf:1/7, mb:0, hnd:16 OUT(1) FM 10, state:4, cluster:fa690006(1), sink:-1, Queue:0-0(0), Buf:1/7, mb:1, hnd:17 When working with UART (Terminal and Uart must be enabled), FruityMesh supports a convenient blocking terminal mode with echo back functionality. For communication with another device such as a MeshGateway, an interrupt based input method and json output is used. To toggle between these two modes, there are two commands. startterm Using startterm will use a blocking mode where all functionality is halted and user input is received in a busy loop until a line feed '\\r' is received. The command will then be processed and other functionality will be resumed. The input will be echoed back on the terminal and backspace is supported as well for most terminal programs. If the command cannot be recognized, a warning will be echoed. stopterm The stopterm command will switch the node into an interrupt based input mode where terminal input does not affect the functionality until a line feed '\\r' is received. All output messages will be in json format. reset If you just want to reset the node via the terminal, enter this command and it will do a software reboot. If you want to synchronize a time over the mesh, you must first set the time to your local node using the settime command. It is internally stored as an unsigned 32 bit integer. settime [u32 unixTimestampSec] [i16 offsetMinutes] Afterwards, you can query the time of the local node using: gettime The output should give you the current time and date of the node in a human readable form. Be aware that this is only an approximate calculation. It is just for debugging if the time was set correctly. Internally, the nodes only work with unix timestamps. get_modules [nodeId] Often, it is necessary to get a list of modules that are available on a node. The returned list includes all modules that are available (compiled into the firmware): their moduleId, their version and whether they are currently active. { \"nodeId\": 1, \"type\": \"module_list\", \"modules\": [ { \"id\": 1, \"version\": 2, \"active\": 1 }, { \"id\": 2, \"version\": 1, \"active\": 0 }, // ... ] Sending raw data can be used to send any arbitrary data, for example (but not limited to) zip files. The data which should be sent is split into various chunks which are then sent through the mesh. The data which should be sent is called the \"payload\". Every raw data transaction (except raw_data_light, which will be explained later) starts with a raw_data_start message. This message includes the amount of chunks in the transaction and the protocol of the payload. Once the receiver receives this message, he answers with a raw_data_start_received message, which indicates to the sender that the receiver is ready for the transaction of the chunks. When the sender receives this message, he starts sending all the raw_data_chunks. Besides part of the payload, every raw_data_chunk includes a chunkID which is a uniquely (regarding the current transaction) ascending number, starting at 1 for the raw_data_chunks. The chunkID 0 is reserved for the raw_data_start which always implicitly has the chunkID 0. Using this chunkID, and the information of the amount of chunks form the raw_data_start message, the receiver is able to determine whether or not a received chunk is the last chunk in the transaction. Once he receives the last chunk he reports back to the sender using a single raw_data_report. This message includes up to three missing chunkIDs. If all chunks were received, the list of missing chunks is empty, which tells the sender that the transaction was successful. If however, the list of missing chunks is not empty, the sender must send the chunks with the corresponding chunkIDs again. The last chunkID of the previous raw_data_report message acts as a last chunk, regarding the sending of additional raw_data_reports. This sending of raw_data_chunks and raw_data_reports is repeated until raw_data_report has an empty list of missing chunkIDs. All devices involved in the communication (meaning both sender and receiver as well as the mesh) are able to cancel the communication by sending a raw_data_error message to the sender as well as the receiver. If the sender or the receiver is the device that hung up the transmission, it is allowed to not send the error to itself. The raw_data_error message includes an error code, indicating the reason for the cancellation. It is possible to receive a raw_data_error message without an open transmission. This can happen for example, if the sender cancels the transmission using a raw_data_error, but this error is dropped during the transmission. The receiver then might send another raw_data_error indicating a timeout while the sender already canceled the communication. Such messages without an open transmission may be discarded. As any other message in the mesh, every message in the raw send protocol could be dropped. This section describes how an implementation must behave in such scenarios. It also tells the obligations of the sender and the receiver. Dropped message Reaction raw_data_start or raw_data_start_received The sender must send the raw_data_start again after a timeout of 10 seconds or stop the transmission. The receiver thus has to be able to handle several successive raw_data_start messages with the same content (in case the raw_data_start_received message is dropped) as well as closing a dropped connection after a timeout of 15 seconds (in case the sender does not send another raw_data_start). raw_data_chunk Missing chunks are reported in raw_data_report once the last chunk is received. These missing chunks must be resent. Last raw_data_chunk or raw_data_report Using the ChunkID, both sender and receiver are able to identify the last data chunk. If this message or the raw_data_report is dropped, the sender must send the last chunk again. This however means that the receiver is only allowed to save the last chunk id once the first chunk after a raw_data_report is received, not immediately after the raw_data_report is sent. raw_data_error If a raw_data_error message is dropped, the sender or receiver has already canceled the transmission, leading to the sending of another raw_data_error upon receiving an invalid out-of-transmission message or a raw_data_error indicating a timeout. In the rare cases where the origin of the raw_data_error is the mesh itself, it could happen that both raw_data_errors are dropped. In such cases the connection is still up but probably will create another raw_data_error once the ill-formed chunk is sent again. raw_data_start [receiverId] [destinationModuleId] [numChunks] [protocolId] {requestHandle = 0} This command starts a raw data transmission. The payload shall be sent using raw_data_chunk messages. Parameter Type Description receiverId u16 The NodeID that this message should be sent to destinationModuleId u8 The ModuleId is used for giving context to this message. If the transmission should only be printed on the receiver and otherwise be ignored by the firmware, it must be set to 0. numChunks u24 Number of Chunks for the total message. Must not be 0. protocolId u8 One of the protocolIds mentioned in the table below requestHandle u8 A handle that can be used to distinguish between different raw data transmissions (Default: 0) Protocol ID Name Description 0 Invalid Invalid Protocol ID 1 HTTP A raw HTTP request or response 2 GZIPPED_JSON A JSON that was gzipped 3 - 199 Reserved Not yet used 200 - 255 User defined May be different in each implementation If received by a JSON capable device, the raw_data_start will be printed out like this: { \"nodeId\":5, \"type\":\"raw_data_start\", \"module\":4, \"numChunks\":3, \"protocol\":1, \"fmKeyId\":2, \"requestHandle\":0 } raw_data_start_received [receiverId] [destinationModuleId] {requestHandle = 0} Once a raw_data_start is received, the receiver shall send the sender a raw_data_start_received message. Parameter Type Description receiverId u16 The NodeID that this message should be sent to destinationModuleId u8 The ModuleId is used for giving context to this message. If the transmission should only be printed on the receiver and otherwise be ignored by the firmware, it must be set to 0. requestHandle u8 A handle that can be used to distinguish between different raw data transmissions (Default: 0) If received by a JSON capable device, the raw_data_start will be printed out like this: { \"nodeId\":5, \"type\":\"raw_data_start_received\", \"module\":4, \"requestHandle\":0 } raw_data_chunk [receiverId] [destinationModuleId] [chunkId] [payloadHex] {requestHandle = 0} Once a raw transmission was started, the appropriate number of chunks should follow in the correct order. Once the last chunk is received by the receiver it is possible to reassemble and parse the whole message. The moduleId is present in all chunks so that they can be assigned to the correct stream and to avoid clashes between different modules. A module can send intermittent data streams if is uses different request handles. Parameter Type Description receiverId u16 The NodeID that this message should be sent to destinationModuleId u8 The ModuleId is used for giving context to this message. If the transmission should only be printed on the receiver and otherwise be ignored by the firmware, it must be set to 0. chunkId u24 ID of this data chunk starting from 0. payloadHex HexString or Base64String The binary data to send. E.g. AA:BB:CC. The maximum length is 60 bytes for HexStrings, 120 bytes for Base64Strings. requestHandle u8 A handle that can be used to distinguish between different raw data transmissions (Default: 0) If received by a JSON capable device, the raw_data_start will be printed out like this: { \"nodeId\":5, \"type\":\"raw_data_chunk\", \"module\":4, \"chunkId\":1, \"payload\":\"abcdeQ==\", \"requestHandle\":0 } raw_data_report [receiverId] [destinationModuleId] [MissingChunkIds] {requestHandle = 0} Once the last chunk is received, the receiver sends this message to the sender, indicating either a successful transmission (empty missing chunk IDs) or informs the sender about missing chunk IDs. Parameter Type Description receiverId u16 The NodeID that this message should be sent to destinationModuleId u8 The ModuleId is used for giving context to this message. If the transmission should only be printed on the receiver and otherwise be ignored by the firmware, it must be set to 0. MissingChunkIds Comma separated Integers or the literal string \"-\" (without \"\") Up to three chunkIDs of missing chunks. Must not contain spaces! E.g. 2,17,312 requestHandle u8 A handle that can be used to distinguish between different raw data transmissions (Default: 0) If received by a JSON capable device, the raw_data_start will be printed out like this: { \"nodeId\":5, \"type\":\"raw_data_report\", \"module\":4, \"missing\":[2,17,312], \"requestHandle\":0 } Or in cases where the transmission was successful: { \"nodeId\":5, \"type\":\"raw_data_report\", \"module\":4, \"missing\":[], \"requestHandle\":0 } raw_data_error [receiverId] [destinationModuleId] [errorCode] [destination] {requestHandle = 0} This command indicates that some error occurred and the transmission must be closed. Will be sent to the receiver as well as the sender. Error Code Name Meaning 1 Unexpected end of transmission Three timeouts happened without receiving a message from the transmission partner. 2 Not in a transmission A raw_data_chunk or raw_data_report was received without an open transmission. 3 Malformed Message A message was received which was malformed and did not fit any other error code. 4 Unsupported Protocol The receiver is unable to interpret the given protocol. 5 Malformed GZIP The receiver got all chunks but could could not unpack the gzip. 6 Malformed Type Thrown in case of a gzip communication. The unpacking worked, but the provided type inside the gzip json was unknown. 7 Invalid Chunk ID The given chunk ID was out of range. 0, 4 - 199 Reserved Not yet used 200 - 255 User defined May be different in each implementation. Destination Code Name Meaning 1 Sender The error is sent to the sender. 2 Receiver The error is sent to the receiver. 3 Both The error is sent both to the sender and the receiver. If received by a JSON capable device, the raw_data_error will be printed out like this: { \"nodeId\":5, \"type\":\"raw_data_error\", \"module\":4, \"error\":1, \"destination\":1 \"requestHandle\":0 } raw_data_light [receiverId] [destinationModuleId] [protocolId] [payload] {requestHandle = 0} Sends a single, responseless chunk of arbitrary data to the receiver. There is no guarantee that the message is transmitted. The sender thus should make sure to have some resending logic. Parameter Type Description receiverId u16 The NodeID that this message should be sent to destinationModuleId u8 The ModuleId is used for giving context to this message. If the transmission should only be printed on the receiver and otherwise be ignored by the firmware, it must be set to 0. protocolId u8 One of the protocolIds mentioned in the table of raw_data_start payloadHex HexString or Base64String The binary data to send. E.g. AA:BB:CC. The maximum length is 60 bytes for HexStrings, 120 bytes for Base64Strings. requestHandle u8 A handle that can be used to distinguish between different raw data transmissions (Default: 0) If received by a JSON capable device, the raw_data_start will be printed out like this: { \"nodeId\":5, \"type\":\"raw_data_light\", \"module\":4, \"protocol\":2, \"payload\":\"abcdeQ==\", \"requestHandle\":0 } The ClusterWelcome Packet is sent be the node that thinks it has the bigger cluster.

Setting up the development environment has become pretty straightforward. You have two possibilities: Flashing the precompiled firmware will take you about 5 minutes. If you want to compile it yourself you need to Setup Eclipse and compile FruityMesh yourself. This will take you a few more minutes until everything is ready to go. The precompiled firmware can be flashed in three easy steps. The nRF Command Line Tools are handy for flashing the compiled firmware on a device. You can download them here for the operating system of your choice and install them: https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/nRF5-Command-Line-Tools The tools come with a bundled installation of the Segger Utilities, which are necessary for flashing and debugging nRF Hardware. You should add the bin/ folder of the installation to your operating system PATH variable to make development easier. Plug in your nrf51 or nrf52 development board via USB, then open a command prompt in the FruityMesh folder and type in the following command for flashing the nrf51 version: C://nrfjprog.exe --chiperase --program binary/fruitymesh_nrf51_s130.hex --reset or the following for nrf52: C://nrfjprog.exe --chiperase --program binary/fruitymesh_nrf52_s132.hex --reset Your output should look like this: If you have multiple boards attached, you will be prompted for the id of your board that should be flashed. You’re now ready to test FruityMesh. Continue by reading the Get Started section. FruityMesh is built using the GCC compiler toolchain together with GNU make. The installation process varies a little for each operating system. Download Version 4.9 of the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain for Windows. This includes the compiler gcc, linker, and multiple utilities like objcopy, addr2line and gdb - the GNU debugger: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.9/4.9-2015-q3-update/ Unzip the downloaded package into a folder of your choice. Do not choose a newer version, as this might fail to compile. Next, if you are working on windows, you have to download and install some unix utilities, the GNU ARM Eclipse Build Tools. This includes make, sh, rm and some others. Version 2.4 has been tested successfully and the executable installer can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools/releases/tag/v2.4b Because most makefiles will also use the mkdir command and maybe some others, you should also download the GNU Coreutils that provide a set of UNIX commands in binary for Windows. Copy at least the mkdir.exe and md5.exe to the bin/ folder of your GNU ARM Build Tools installation. You must also download the dependencies and copy these to the same folder (Two .dll files). Binaries: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/coreutils-bin-zip.php Dependencies: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/coreutils-dep-zip.php Finally, you should add the bin folders of the gnu buildtools and the bin folder of gcc-arm-embedded to your PATH variable under System Environment. This will make sure that you can access these tools from anywhere. The last step, before you can build the project is to duplicate Makefile.local.template and name it Makefile.local Open Makefile.local and give the correct path to your gcc installation: FRUITYMESH_GNU_INSTALL_ROOT := C:/ You can also specify the PLATFORM (NRF51 or NRF52) and give a different Featureset for the build. Next, open a command prompt in the fruitymesh folder and type: make If everything was set up correctly and the location of make was correctly entered in the PATH variable of your operating system, everything should build. If you installed the nRF Command Line Tools and properly configured the PATH, you can now type: make flash to flash the firmware on a device. Eclipse is a good development IDE for FruityMesh. The project settings are already included and all you have to do is download GNU MCU Eclipse, which already contains the necessary plugins for Embedded Development from here: https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/org.eclipse.epp.packages/releases After starting Eclipse, all you have to do is to import the FruityMesh project. You can then develop, flash and debug in a comfortable way. Now, let’s see how we can use FruityMesh. The preconmpiled firmware and the standard project settings are configured so that all devices immediately connect to each other. Start by plugging in your first develoipment kit. (On Windows, Putty is the best tool. The screen utility can be used on macOS or Linux.) You have to connect to UART using the following settings: Connection Type: Serial Speed: 1000000 Data bits: 8 Stop Bits: 1 Parity: None Flow control: RTS/CTS (Hardware) Note to OSX users: To find out which serial port to open, you can list all devices under /dev/cu.* and pick the one that says usbmodem. Once your terminal is connected to the serial port, press the reset button on the Development Kit and the Terminal should provide you with some output similar to this: If you don’t get output immediately it will sometimes help to disconnect the Devkit from USB for a short time or try to write something. This is an issue of the SEGGER Debugger chipset that bridges the UART. You may now enter a number of commands to trigger actions. Here are some important ones: status: will show you the status of the node and its connections reset: performs a system reset data: sends data through the mesh that other nodes will output to the terminal Next, flash and connect another node to the network and you should observe that they connect to each other after a short amount of time. You’ll see that the LEDs will switch from blinking red to a single green pattern. If you enter the command action 0 io leds on, both nodes should switch their led to white (all LEDs on). After you enter action 0 io leds off, it will go back to connection signaling mode. Now, connect with another Terminal to the second Node and enter data in the command prompt and observe how the data is sent to the other node and outputted on the other terminal. You can add as many nodes as you like to the network and see how it reacts. If you remove a node, the network will try to repair this connection. You can observe the size change of the cluster by entering status from time to time. Two nodes will only connect to each other once they have been enrolled in the same network. The github configuration will automatically have all nodes enrolled in the same network after flashing. If you do not want this, take a look at the UICR configuration. Take a look at the Features page for a detailed overview of the possibilities and check out Usage for usage instructions. If you’re ready to contribute to the development of FruityMesh, see Developers for a roadmap and for instructions on how to take part. If you want to start programming with FruityMesh, you should definitely have a look at the Tutorials page for some guided introduction.

It is used for storing persistent data, for example the enrollment data of a node or the module settings. Internally, it uses the FlashStorage to access the flash and queue its operations. The RecordStorage is fully fail safe against power loss and corruption. It will intelligently write all records to a single flash page until it is full and will swap the valid data to another page (defragmentation) once space is needed thereby minimizing erase operations on the flash. Most important features of RecordStorage are: creating new records in memory updating existing records deleting existing records protection against power loss defragmentation A record is identified by its recordId, thus every record need to have unique recordId. Records store some metadata like: id, lenght, crc and the record version in addition to the data. The crc of the record is checked every time a record is accessed. Records with invalid crc will be ignored and removed during next defragmentation or swap. The versionCounter is used determine the version of the record. When a record is updated, it is not deleted, but new record with incremented versionCounter is created. When reading, only the record with newest versionCounter is returned, which means that a record becomes inactive as soon as a newer version of this record is stored. Inactive records are removed during defragmentation. The versionCounter and pageVersion have a maximum of 65535. This is the maximum number of times a record can be updated and the maximum number of times that pages can be swapped. Record storage needs to be assigned a number of pages in flash memory that are not used by the application. The minimium number of pages is 2 (one data and 1 swap page). The swap page is the page that currently does not contain any data. Whenever all other pages are full, the page which can be defragmented the most is defragmented and copied to the swap page. After validation of the records, the old page is erased and becomes the swap page. During defragmentation, all active records will be moved but inactive records will be omitted. Saving or updating records and deleting them are all non-blocking operations which are cached and executed asynchronously. Users can register listener when scheduling operation to get notified once the operation was executed. In the handler, the user will get information about the result of the operation. A userType and user context data can be given to determine the operation. Reading from recordStorage is done synchronously as a simple access to flash memory.

Some of the protocol decisions are found on this page and ongoing discussions will show whether some of these specifications should be changed. FruityMesh uses a number of advertising packets, the most important one being the JOIN_ME packet that is used for discovery of nearby nodes that also run FruityMesh. There are two types of advertising packets used by FruityMesh. One uses the manufacturer specific adv structure, the other uses the serviceData adv structure. Table 1. Advertising Header with Manufacturer Specific Data Bytes Type Name Description 3 advStructureFlags Flags Mandatory Flags Adv Structure 4 advStructureManufacturer Manufacturer Data Manufacturer Specific Adv Structure with 0x024D as company identifier. 1 u8 meshIdentifier Identifies this as a mesh advertising packet 2 NetworkId networkId The networkId of this node 1 u8 messageType Used to identify a number of different advertising messages within the mesh The company id 0x024D (M-Way Solutions GmbH) is registered with the Bluetooth SIG and may be used by any implementation that conforms to the latest specifications of the FruityMesh protocol. The mesh identifier is 0xF0. No other identifier shall be used. Future versions might change this identifier. The purpose of the mesh identifier is to enable different protocols under the same manufacturer id. The network identifier can be changed by the user. In combination with the networkKey, this allows different meshes to co-exist in the same physical area. It is set either during flashing or during enrollment. The messageType is used to distinguish between different messages. The same messageType definitions are used for advertising packets and for connection packets. This allows us to send the same message over another \"transport\" if desired and compatible with the message format. The JOIN_ME packet contains all the information that other nodes can use to determine their best connection partner. MessageId in the header must be set to 1. Future JOIN_ME packets can have a different messageId and different values that can then be used in the Cluster Score Function. The current implementation uses the clusterSize and the number of freeIn and freeOut connections. Bytes Type Name Description 11 advHeaderManufacturerSpecific header The above depicted manufacturer specific header 2 NodeId sender The nodeId of the sending node 4 ClusterId clusterId Consists of the founding node’s id and the connection loss / restart counter 2 ClusterSize clusterSize The number of nodes in this cluster 3 bit u8 : 3 freeMeshInConnections Number of free in connections (as peripheral) 5 bit u8 : 5 freeMeshOutConnections Number of free out connections (as central) 1 u8 batteryRuntime Contains the expected runtime of the device (1-59=minutes, 60-83=1-23hours, 84-113=1-29days, 114-233=1-119months, 234-254=10-29year, 255=infinite) 1 i8 txPower power of two’s complement in dBm 1 u8 deviceType check DeviceTypes 2 u16 hopsToSink Number of hops to the shortest sink 2 u16 meshWriteHandle The GATT handle for the mesh communication characteristic 4 ClusterId ackField Contains the acknowledgement from another node for the slave connection procedure Another type of advertising packets used by FruityMesh uses the Service Data Adv Structure. This is important when dealing with mobile devices as some have hardware filtering with no support for manufacturer specific data. Bytes Type Name Description Mandatory data - - - 3 Flags advStructureFlags (len, type, flags byte) 4 Service UUID complete advStructureUUID16 (len, type, 2 byte UUID 0xFE12) 4 Service Data header advStructureServiceData (len, type, 2 byte UUID 0xFE12) CustomDataHeader - - - 2 u16 messageType Used to determine between different messages. FruityMesh can be used to distribute all advertising packets that conform to the BLE specification. These can be Eddystone, iBeacon or any other kind of advertising messages. These are however not essential for FruityMesh itself and are therefore not documented here. Have a look at the AdvertisingModule for more information. The mesh uses a number of packets that are sent over connections. Most packets that are sent over connections must have this header. There are some exceptions to this (e.g. split packets use a two byte message header for less overhead. The messageType is used to identify if the connPacketHeader is used or not. Table 2. Format of a connPacketHeader Bytes Type Name Description 1 u8 messageType The type of message 2 u16 senderId The nodeId of the sender 2 u16 receiverId The nodeId of the receiver Modules use an extended message header to guarantee that there are no collisions between different functionality. This extended header is used for the following messageTypes: MessageType Name Description 51 / 0x33 MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION A request for a node to perform an action 52 / 0x33 MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_ACTION_RESPONSE Response message for a previous request 53 / 0x33 MESSAGE_TYPE_MODULE_GENERAL An event that does not need a response The following describes the format of the extended header: Table 3. Format of a connPacketModule Bytes Type Name Description 5 connPacketHeader header The standard connPacketHeader used for all messages. 1 u8 moduleId The id of a module, a module provides different functionality for one specific task. 1 u8 requestHandle A handle that can be used e.g. like a counter. Responses will always be returned with the same handle given in the request. 1 u8 actionType This is the type of action that should be executed by the module. An individual list of subCommands is available for each of the messageTypes given above. E.g. there could be a MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION message with the actionType set to 1 (PING) to execute a ping. The response would be a MODULE_ACTION_RESPONSE message with the actionType set to 1 (PING_RESPONSE). …​ u8[] data additional payload data for the command A nodeId is a way of addressing devices in a network. Each device in a network must have a unique nodeId assigned to it that must not clash with the nodeId of another device. There are different nodeId ranges that are used for different purposes: 0: is used as the broadcast address to reach all nodes in a network 1 - 1999: is used to uniquely address devices (nodes, sinks, …​) 2000 - 19 999: is used for virtual addresses to address smartphones connected to the mesh 20 000 - 20 999: is used to address groups 30000: is the address for the current node itself 30 001 - 30 999: is used to specify the number of hops that a packet can travel. (30 001 e.g. specifies that the packet must only reach the direct neighbours) 31 000: - is used when a packet should travel to the shortest sink possible (not yet implemented) 33000 - 39 999 - Can be used to assign nodeIds uniquely over multiple meshes for the same organization All other nodeIds are currently reserved The serial numbers are assigned randomly using the chipId when developing with the open source variant. They should however be uniquely assigned using the UICR once devices go into production. Contact us before using serial numbers in production with the M-Way manufacturing id. The serialNumberIndex is a 32 bit unsigned integer that can be uniquely mapped from and to a serial number using the GenerateBeaconSerialForIndex and GetIndexForSerial methods in the Utility class. There are a number of different keys used throughout FruityMesh. These are all 128 bit keys that are used for AES encryption between the nodes and for communication with Smartphones or other devices. Can only be used if a node is not enrolled and uses a key filled with 0x00 for encryption. This key is used for the lifetime of a device and is uniquely generated during production. It must be kept secure because it allows full configuration access, e.g. enrolling and removing the enrollment. The network key is shared between all nodes that belong to a mesh network. Whoever is in posession of this key can configure all nodes in the network and can sent any message he likes. It is important to keep this key secret, but it is possible to change it if it ever leaks out. This is a key that cannot be used to connect, but only to derive all other user keys from it. The organization key is shared between all networks of an organization. It allows access to a limited set of functionality, e.g. necessary for tracking assets between differen meshes. If the organization key leaks, it is necessary to reconfigure all meshes of the organization. The restrained key is generated given the node key. It can be seen as a node key with limited access rights. The restrained key can be derived from the node key by using an AES-128 bit encryption by encrypting the ASCII-String \"RESTRAINED_KEY00\" (without terminating 0) using the node key as the AES key. Example values are: Node Key Restrained Key 00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 2A:FC:35:99:4C:86:11:48:58:4C:C6:D9:EE:D4:A2:B6 FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA:99:88:77:66:55:44:33:22:11:00 9E:63:8B:94:65:85:91:99:A9:74:7D:A7:40:7C:DD:B3 DE:AD:BE:EF:DE:AD:BE:EF:DE:AD:BE:EF:DE:AD:BE:EF 3C:58:54:FC:29:96:00:59:B7:80:6B:4C:78:49:8B:27 00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0A:0B:0C:0D:0E:0F 60:AB:54:BB:F5:1C:3F:77:FA:BC:80:4C:E0:F4:78:58 The user base key is used to generate a range of many million user keys that can be given to users or user groups. A user key allows access to a limited set of commands and can be restricted to functionality depending on the use case. If the userBaseKey leaks, all userKeys have to be regenerated and distributed to users. Note: A key that is filled with 0xFF is considered invalid and cannot be used. There are different device types that are given to nodes with specific functionality: DeviceType Name Description 0 DEVICE_TYPE_INVALID Not used 1 DEVICE_TYPE_STATIC A node that is installed somewhere with a position that will not change much over time. 2 DEVICE_TYPE_ROAMING A node that can move around freely. 3 DEVICE_TYPE_SINK A node that is installed at a fix place and collects all the data (typically a MeshGateway). 4 DEVICE_TYPE_ASSET A node that moves around and broadcasts its presence so that it can be detected by a mesh. 5 DEVICE_TYPE_LEAF A node that will only connect to the mesh as a leaf but will not relay data (Useful if its position changes but it needs a constant data connection) The UICR is a special persistant storage that is used to store factory defaults once a node is flashed. The NRF_UICR→CUSTOMER area is used to store the data on nRF chips. If you want to store a serial number, nodeKey, etc,…​ for a node, you must write the UICR during flashing. The NRF_UICR→CUSTOMER area is used for that purpose and starts at 0x10001080. You can use srec_cat to produce a .hex file containing the desired UICR data. This can then be merged with the SoftDevice and Application or you can flash each one after the other. FruityMesh will boot with random data (random nodeId / serialNumber / …​) if no data is present in the UICR. The data will however be persistent across reboots as it is generated according to the internal chip id from the FICR.

The module will allow us to measure the battery consumption of each individual application and also aid in estimating the throughput of the network. The Testing Module has two roles. Master: Testing Module by default starts in test role \"Master\". Master node initialises the tests by sending a start test message to the node which will perform tests. Slave: Testing Module changes its role to slave when it receives a message to start test. Each test runs for a maximum of 30 secs. Master node initialises every test by first connecting to the slave node and then sending a message to start test. On the other hand slave node acknowledges this start test message, disconnect from partner and switch LEDs on for 2 sec to indicate the start of test. The applications currently being tested are Advertisement, Scanning, LED, Latency and Connection Tests. Application Name Application Id ALL 0 LED Test 1 Advertisement Test 2 Scanning Test 3 Connection Test 4 Latency Test 5 Detailed description of these application are given below. Slave node switch red LED on for 10 sec and do nothing and then switch green LED on and do nothing. Advertisement test is performed by using different values of following advertisement parameters. Advertisement types used by Testing Module are Connectable Undirected: Advertisement type where any device can send scan response packet and connect request to the advertiser.

Changes have been made to the state machine and the slave connection procedure and are not documented yet. The final algorithm is presented here and offers a solution for building a graph which is only based on the knowledge of surrounding nodes. It enables automatic meshing that is functional and constructs a spanning tree with all reachable nodes. Loop building is effectively prevented. It is self-healing in case of node loss or short-lived node failure and can be optimized for a number of use-cases by customizing a cluster score function. This results in different spanning tree configurations. Nodes can be switched on at different times and even after the route setup has finished. Every node is always part of a cluster with a unique Cluster Id which is generated by the founding member. A single node with no connections represents a cluster with the size of one. Only nodes that are part of different clusters will connect to each other and exchange their cluster information. This information is evaluated in the Cluster Score function. The node that is part of the bigger cluster can decide which connections it wants to make and will convert nodes from smaller clusters to its own cluster. The increased cluster size must then be reported back to the rest of the cluster. Size information will be passed through the existing connections which is an energy efficient way of distributing information. If nodes disconnect from a cluster either voluntary or because of timeouts, the size of the cluster must be decreased according to the number of nodes that were lost. This requires each node to save the quantity of connected nodes for each active connection. Before a node can join a network, it must be assigned a Node Id and a Network Id. In case of an encrypted network, it must also possess the network encryption key that will be shared among all nodes in the network. The Node Ids do not have to follow a scheme but must be unique for that network. The Network Id allows different networks to coexist in the same physical space. These values are configured in the enrolment process. After booting, a node generates a new Cluster Id based on its Node Id and the total number of connection losses. The initial Cluster Size of a node must be set to 1. A value called Connected Cluster Size must be saved for each of the possible connections (1 outgoing, 3 incoming) and is initialized with 0. 7 depicts a node that is directly connected with two other nodes and gives an overview of the stored values. Figure: Example of the stored values in a node During the discovery phase, a node will constantly broadcast its Node Id, Cluster Id and its Cluster Size in an advertising packet. This packet has been called the JOIN_ME packet and can also include further attributes that other nodes use to calculate the Cluster Score. The advertising packet must be connectable if the incoming connection is still free, otherwise it is non-connectable. Between sending these advertising packets, a node must scan on all advertising channels for packets of surrounding nodes. These are collected in a buffer and only the most recent packet from a node is saved with a timestamp of the reception time. After a predefined amount of seconds, a node calculates its best connection partner based on the collected JOIN_ME packets. At first, it looks for nodes that have a freeIn connection and tries to connect as a master. Each packet is evaluated with the Cluster Score function, which returns a connection score. This score is zero if the node belongs to the same cluster or if the other cluster is bigger. (If both are similar//TODOm: similiar or the same?/ in size, the Cluster Id is used to determine the winner). After processing all packets, the algorithm tries to connect to the highest ranked node. Therefore, it needs to listen for another advertising packet which it will answer with a connection request. In case of success, the two nodes must then perform a handshake. Before the handshake is finished, the newly connected node cannot participate in the network and must not send any packets except those belonging to the handshake. Both nodes start the handshake by sending a CLUSTER_WELCOME packet which includes the latest information about their Cluster Size and Cluster Id because the available information might already be outdated. This can result in a few different cases: a) If they already belong to the same cluster, they must disconnect because they are already linked through other nodes. This is done to ensure that there is not more than one link between nodes of the same cluster. in the same network. b) If they have different Cluster Ids, one of the nodes will have a smaller Cluster Size (In case they are equal, the value of the nodeId decides). This node must then disconnect all other connections and must join the bigger cluster. It saves its new Cluster Id and the Cluster Size which it increments by one. Afterwards, it sends a CLUSTER_ACK packet to its connection partner that confirms its entrance to the cluster. This marks the end of the handshake. After the partner has received this packet it will increment the Cluster Size and it will send a CLUSTER_UPDATE message to other nodes that informs them of the size change. The packet contains either a size increment or decrement and not the absolute size of the cluster. Sending the absolute value would not work because there is no guarantee that all nodes hold the same Cluster Size at one time. Cluster Size decrements will be sent as soon as a node encounters a disconnection for any reason. Because it knows the number of nodes that were connected through this connection, it can send the appropriate decrement message. This even works in a situation where the other node fails to respond and a timeout is generated. After disconnecting from nodes of the same cluster, there are two separated networks with the same Cluster Id. Because that would result in the forming of islands (disjoint clusters), the smaller cluster has to distribute a new Cluster Id. The new Cluster Id is sent with the same CLUSTER_UPDATE packet that contains the size decrement after a connection was lost. The new Cluster Id is based on the Node Id that just lost the connection. To generate the new Cluster Id, the connection loss counter is merged with the Node Id to ensure that the same Cluster Id is not in use twice which would result in two disjoint clusters with the same id. Nodes that belong to bigger clusters can always decide which connections are made and will dissolve smaller clusters. If adjacent devices are switched on one by one, they can instantly connect to the mesh. But if two different cluster meet at one point, the bigger cluster will force the small cluster to reform until there is only one cluster left. After the network has been formed, the JOIN_ME packets will all advertise the same Cluster Id. This will gradually cause all nodes to switch to a lower discovery mode when no changes are detected for a long time. They will then scan the network less frequently and send fewer advertising messages. It is possible to switch off discovery entirely after all known nodes have connected to the network but this will prevent any new nodes from joining the network. If a node is disconnected, it will be able to join again because its previous connection partner will notice the disconnection and will then switch on discovery. The network will always try to reconnect to disconnected nodes because they will have a different Cluster Id after the disconnection. Alternative routes are formed as well which means that the network is self-healing. Routing in the spanning tree of the network has not been a major focus because of the variety of solutions that are already available. Some ideas and thoughts are provided for a number of different types of messages. Broadcast messages do not require any form of routing. A broadcast message can originate from either a sink or from any node in the network. It is then retransmitted through every connection except the connection from where it was received. Node to sink messages are considered to be another common message type. If we assume that the number of sinks in a network is a low number then each node can hold a simple routing table that contains the Node Id of each sink and the appropriate connection with which they can be reached. This information must be broadcasted by a sink when it initially joins the mesh and is propagated with the CLUSTER_UPDATE messages. When coupling this information with a hop counter, it is possible to route information to the closest sink when required. One can also use a simpler implementation where each connection is only denoted with a Boolean that specifies whether any sink is reachable through this link or not. Node to Node messages are the most complex scenario because a node may not be able to hold a full routing table with its limited memory resources. In this case, distributed routing tables, data centric routing or other techniques must be considered for optimization. Otherwise, messages will need to be broadcasted. Sink to Node messages are similar to the previous category. In many scenarios, a sink will be connected to another network or to a device with more resources in terms of processing power and memory. This device can hold a number of network quality measurements and an inventory of connected nodes. If each node provides its connection partners it is then possible to build a full routing tree and use this information for more intelligent routing e.g. by adding routing information to a packet. Some use-cases will also require to separate the network in a number of groups. If the number of groups is low enough to be kept in memory, each node may employ a routing table for routing to different groups. A simulation has been implemented to evaluate the proposed algorithm. A number of improvements have been incorporated to tweak the algorithm’s performance based on this simulation. In its final form, the algorithm produced a connected mesh network in all cases in a number of simulations. Routing has not been implemented and only broadcast messages are supported. Some of the simulation results are shown in the next section. A number of different node setups have been evaluated and the simulation results have been plotted. All nodes were switched on at the same time. The simulation shows that most networks look random at the beginning but once a bigger connected cluster has been established, it will begin to dissolve smaller clusters and will absorb them as seen in 2, where the final cluster starts forming from the lower right. Figure: Captures of the clustering phase (top left to bottom right) It is visible that smaller clusters dissolve and must restructure after connection with a bigger cluster. This could be avoided in some cases. Further research must show whether a new Cluster Id can be distributed in a way that leaves both clusters intact and joins them together. Figure Comparing a sparse (left) and a dense (right) 20-node setup A direct comparison between a sparse and a denser node setup shows that the connection losses and the average connection time are higher when each node can choose between many connection partners. This seems counter intuitive at first because more connection partners should result in a faster network setup. But it is visible that clusters tend to reconnect and dissolve often. The dense setup also shows that nodes do not connect to their nearest neighbours because the RSSI has not been used in the Cluster Score function. Choosing better parameters should therefore be an important topic of future research as well. Figure: Comparing two different setups with 200 nodes The time it takes to form the network increases approximately linearly with the number of nodes involved while the number of average connection losses will top out at about 10. (The maximum number of nodes that were simulated is 400.) The number of sent CLUSTER_UPDATE packets does also increase linearly with the size of the network. This can possibly be improved by buffering and sending less packets if they are only used to report an increased cluster size. Figure: Self-healing process (left to right) The algorithm provides self-healing capabilities. Once a node is removed (seen in the second picture of 5), the nodes to the left will rearrange to join the cluster through a different route. If this previously removed node is switched on again it will be reconnected to the cluster, but only as a leaf node and not as an integral part of the network. This results in separation of failing nodes from the core of the network and therefore enhances the stability during its lifetime. Broadcasting a connection loss metric with the JOIN_ME packets could therefore allow the algorithm to form more stable networks by rating nodes based on their connection stability. Sometimes, a node cannot connect to a smaller cluster because the only reachable node is already connected by another master and has thus used up its incoming connection. We must then tell the node to disconnect its current connection. This can have some side effects. Figure: Problematic connection situation When node A broadcasts its JOIN_ME packet, node B must disconnect from its current cluster. After node B has disconnected, it will start advertising and node A will try to connect to it. This will fail because node B is not able to physically reach node A because of its limited send range. This results in permanent disconnections and battery depletion and must therefore be solved. One solution is to add an ACK field to the JOIN_ME packet, which can contain a Node Id. Node A can set this field to the Node Id of node B, which it will only know if it already received JOIN_ME packets from node B previously. Node B will then receive this packet and must now disconnect its connection and advertise its presence so that node A can establish a connection. This will again result in another problem because its previous cluster might try to connect again. In the current implementation, node B will set the Node Id of node A in the ACK field of the JOIN_ME packets to signal its preferred connection partner, but it has to be evaluated whether directed advertising messages provide better results. Using the slave connection procedure takes more time because of this challenge and response scheme. Because of the limited number of bytes that can – and should – be transmitted between devices, it is necessary to implement a binary communication protocol. All data types and packet declarations can be found in inc/types.h. Some of the most common data types are: The nodeID has a size of 2 bytes which allows for a theoretical limit of about 65,000 uniquely identifiable nodes per mesh network. This does also determine the maximum clusterSize with an identical length of 2 bytes. The clusterID uses 4 bytes because it must include a nodeID and a Connection Loss Counter. The number of freeIn connections and freeOut are combined into one byte by using a bitmask. Advertising packets make use of the Manufacturer Specific Data AD Type to broadcast their mesh related data. *Figure: Structure of a JOIN_ME packet * The 2 byte Company Identifier that is part of the Manufacturer Specific Data header has been set to 0x024D which is the registered company identifier of the M-Way Solutions GmbH. A Mesh Identifier has been selected with a length of two bytes that shall be used to check if the packet is intended for FruityMesh (0xF0). This allows for multiple protocols with the same Company Identifier. The Network Identifier allows to have multiple networks in the same physical space and prevents mix-up of discovery packets. The last value that belongs to the custom advertising message header is the Message Type, which allows to send a total of 256 different messages of which only 4 are currently defined. One of these messages is the JOIN_ME packet that is explained here as an example. The JOIN_ME packet contains all the information that a receiver must know to decide whether it wants to connect to this node or not. This includes the Node Id, Cluster Id, Cluster Size and the number of free connections. Further research must show if additional data should be integrated in this packet. The Write Handle is used to transmit a GATT handle that the mesh implementation uses for communication between two connected nodes. In order to skip the Service and Attribute Discovery, this is sent in the JOIN_ME packet. Connection packets do always include the Message Type, Node Id of the sender, and that of the receiver. Larger packets are automatically split by the implementation and transmitted in subsequent packets. Figure: CLUSTER_WELCOME packet structure The shown CLUSTER_WELCOME packet is one of the packets that can be sent through connections, and it is the first one that is sent during the handshake once a connection has been build up. The main function uses an event handling loop that is entered as soon as the initialization phase is completed. The event handler routine blocks as soon as there are no more events to process and lets the device sleep until an event is generated in the SoftDevice. This event handling is thread save and events will be processed in the order in which they are generated. An event will be dispatched to different event handlers for advertising, scanning, services and connections where it is either pre-processed and then delegated to the C++ classes or completely handled. Because cluster size changes are communicated through increase or decrease messages, it is important that a node always handles these messages correctly because a failure to do so will result in inconsistent data. The algorithm uses a state machine to manage its tasks, which is represented in a simplified form here: Figure: Simplified FruityMesh state flowchart After a node is initialized, it enters the DISCOVERY_HIGH state in which it tries to connect to other clusters as soon as possible. After a timeout of a few seconds, it changes to the DECISION state where it decides whether it wants to connect to another cluster. If no other cluster was found, it sleeps for a few seconds in the BACK_OFF state to conserve energy. After several loops without finding another cluster, it will use the DISCOVERY_LOW state instead of DISCOVERY_HIGH. This allows the node to save more energy by scanning and advertising less and is important when a node is switched on in places without other nodes or if the network has been fully discovered. The node will change to the DISCOVERY_HIGH state again as soon as it receives a packet from a different cluster. When a smaller cluster has been found, the node attempts to connect to it (CONNECTING) which is followed by a handshake procedure (HANDSHAKE). The ACK field is updated as part of the Slave Connection Procedure. The DISCOVERY_HIGH and DISCOVERY_LOW state do only differ in the duty cycles of advertising and scanning operations and the timeouts. In these states, a node alternates advertising and scanning for JOIN_ME packets. If a packet is received, it is saved to the JOIN_ME buffer with a timestamp. An older JOIN_ME packet from the same node is always overwritten in the buffer. Old packets are also replaced when there is no more space in the JOIN_ME buffer left. No further processing is done in the DISCOVERY states. The buffered packets are evaluated with the cluster score function in order to determine the best connection partner. At first, the node tries to find a connection partner that can accept an incoming connection. It will try to connect if one is found. If there are no good candidates available, it tries to invoke the Slave Connection Procedure that has been explained previously. If there is a packet in the buffer that contains its Node Id in the ACK field, it must disconnect its connections and change to the DISCOVERY_HIGH state again. The BACK_OFF state helps to reduce energy consumption. It has a random timeout that prevents nodes from simultaneously entering the state multiple times. This would prevent nodes from discovering each other. While the ATT protocol is not the best fit for managing data streams it can be made to work in such a way. This has been done by implementing a mesh Service with a single Characteristic that is used to transfer data. Both connected devices are allowed to send Write Commands/Requests which trigger an event handler on the receiving side. This enables a bidirectional connection. Because every device knows the Node Id of its connection partners, it is possible to implement a GATT bridge. This would allow us to exploit the strength of the GATT protocol and use all of its features over the mesh. With a GATT bridge, it is also possible to query existing BLE devices over the mesh that are not capable to work in a mesh. This is a key feature that should be implemented in a future version. After discovering the handles, the mesh has to perform a handshake during which both nodes send their current cluster information (CLUSTER_WELCOME). The connection is only set active after this handshake has finished and is not used to relay any data in the meantime. An active connection can receive data packets and relay them to other nodes. A message is relayed to all connections if the destination Node Id is set to 0, which signifies a broadcast packet. There are multiple types of possible messages. CLUSTER_INFO_UPDATE messages are used to transmit the latest cluster size and id. Other important messages have their own type while user-messages should be encapsulated within Module messages. By using data aggregation, it is possible to combine multiple packets in one packet. This reduces the overhead of the protocol and can be used to save energy. Advanced algorithms for data compression and filtering can be used as well. But these can all be implemented on top of the protocol without altering its functionality. The Cluster Score function can be altered to take several aspects into account. For example broadcasting the remaining battery resources in the JOIN_ME packet will result in a network that is first built with devices with extended power supplies. After the core network has been built, it will be joined by the remaining devices with less battery capacity. These will have to manage a lower number of links and data packets. It is also preferable to include the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) in this packetin combination with a dynamically configured TX powerin order to achieve stable links that need less transmission power and have a higher robustness against interference. Smartphones and other moving devices should broadcast a mobile-flag in their discovery packets in order to be excluded from the network’s core. It is better to add moving devices as edges to the network tree so that the network does not need to constantly reform. Connection timeouts must be chosen in a way that connection loss is only encountered sparsely to prevent the network from reconfiguring. The timeout should depend on the environment in terms of interference and physical facts and on the speed at which the network must react to changes. Connection properties like Slave Latency and Connection Interval can be handled between two nodes independently from the network. If both are connected to power they can agree on a small connection interval. This would reduce the hop latency and improve overall network performance. Another improvement that is currently not implemented would require nodes to use a low connection interval for fast network setup and scale down afterwards in order to shorten the discovery time.

There is one big restriction when it comes to BLE connections. Having more than one connection as a Peripheral can degrade mesh performance and lead to connection losses. Using one connection as a Peripheral and up to three connections as a Central has proven a good configuration for mesh connections. With these settings, the following will lead to problems where two nodes cannot connect to each other because their one connection as a Peripheral is already taken. There is no way to know the size - or the participating nodes - of our mesh in advance. Distributing the presence of a node over long distances would be a bad idea because of the time it takes and the energy it costs. This means that every node can only see its surroundig nodes. There is a Simulator available that will show you how the algorithm works. It allows you to play around with different configurations and see how the mesh reacts. Each node saves a few variables like network id, cluster id, cluster size and its own id. Additionally it keeps some information for each of its connections. During discovery, it broadcasts its nodeId, clusterSize and clusterId along with a few other measures in special advertising packets (JOIN_ME packets). It will also scan for some time to receive discovery packets of surrounding nodes. From these packets, it selects the best connection partner and connects to him. Now, the real trick here is the clustering. Because every node knows the size of the cluster that it’s part of, it uses this as a criteria when connecting to others. Big clusters can always decide to which nodes they want to connect and smaller clusters will have to obey. Any change in cluster size due to connection or disconnection is broadcasted through the exisiting connections. After a few JOIN_ME packets have been collected, these are processed in the ClusterScore function to determine the best connection partner. A node will never try to connect to a node with the same clusterId which does effectively prevent loops. After receiving the JOIN_ME packets, some time has passed and the other node might already be in another cluster or in a different state than before. This is why the two nodes will first do a handshake after connecting where they pass each other the latest information. Only one Handshake must happen at a time to prevent race conditions. Once they are satisfied with their partner, the connection can be used, otherwise it will be disconnected. The algorithm uses a state machine that switches between different DISCOVERY and HANDSHAKE states. This helps the node to reduce its energy usage. Once a connection in the cluster breaks up, the smaller cluster distributes a new cluster id among its nodes. This will ultimately repair the missing connection through a similar way. After each connection loss, a node will increment its connection-loss-counter. This counter is used together with the nodeId to generate a clusterID, this is necessary because there might be cases where the founding node of a cluster can not join the cluster anymore if it generates the same clusterID again. Master Bit Because a node cannot know for certain at any time if it is part of the bigger cluster, there might be times where two connected nodes both think they are part of the bigger cluster, which would pose a threat to our mesh once the connection drops. Therefore, each connection is assigned a masterBit that is passed to the node that is part of the bigger cluster. Now, it is only possible that the masterBit is in transition during a disconnect and both cluster must dissolve, but they cannot form islands anymore. Anybody interested in a much more detailed explanation of the Algorithm is welcome to take a look at The Algorithm in Detail page.

Once two nodes are connected to each other, they do a handshake which is signaled by a blue LED. Once they are connected and handshaked, they signal their connection with a single short green blink. The number of green blinks tells you the number of active connections to other nodes. If your hardware does not have colored LEDs, the LEDs are LED1 for red, LED2 for green and LED3 for blue. All classes can implement an interface called TerminalCommandListener which allows them to listen for commands entered via either the UART or Segger RTT terminal. These commands can either be entered by the user or by a program such as a MeshGateway that connects a mesh to the internet. You need some terminal application to input the following commands as detailed in Quick Start. Some basic commands for testing the mesh are listed below. Content in [brackets] has to be replaced by the user. reset: Reboots the system. status: Displays the node’s status, including its connections. data: Sends a test packet to all connected nodes and prints a line once the output was received. datal: Sends a big test packet, that is automatically split into multiple writes over the mesh and prints a line once it was received. action 0 io led [on/off]: Broadcasts a packet to all nodes to switch on/off their leds permanently. action 0 status get_device_info: Asks all nodes for their device information. debugtags: Displays all log tags that are currently enabled. debug [tagname]: Toggle log output of the given tag. (ERROR and WARNING are always printed) debug all : Toggles logging of all messages, no matter what their tag is (this will be a lot of messages) settime [unix timestamp]: Sets the time for the current node sendtime: Broadcasts the current time over the mesh gettime: Displays the current time startterm: Displays a prompt and echos back the user’s input (default). Backspace is supported. stopterm: Uses an interrupt based input mode and is used for communication with a control application. There will be no echo of the user input. bufferstat: Displays the contents of the JOIN_ME buffer which is filled with discovery packets from surrounding nodes. get_modules [nodeId]: Displays a list of modules from the node and whether they are active or not. Have a look at the NodeIDs section for some insights on how you can address nodes individually or in groups. FruityMesh is structured in Modules. Each module provides its own set of commands. A detailed listing of all available modules and their commands can be found on the Modules page.

It was the first open source implementation of a mesh network that is based on standard Bluetooth Low Energy 4.1 connections. In contrast to meshes that use advertising and scanning, this allows for a network run with battery powered devices. FruityMesh works with the Nordic nRF51 or nRF52 chipset in combination with the S130/S132 SoftDevices and enables tons of devices to connect to each other with its auto-meshing capabilities. It is always connected with configurable connection intervals of 7.5 ms to 4 seconds while still being able to run on batteries. BlueRange is our commercial product that includes our Mesh, MeshGateway, Platform, Asset Tracking and much more. Have a look at our website: https://www.bluerange.io/ It’s been a long time, but we finally released our latest version of FruityMesh with tons of new additions and a lot of refactoring and documentation. Go to the Features page to find out more. Documentation is the key and therefore, you should have a look at the documentation to get you started. You can find it as part of the repository in the doc folder: Documentation Before you begin, you should have at least two boards with the nRF51/nRF52 chipsets and either an external or an onboard debugger. If not, I suggest that you get two DevKits from Nordic to get you started as easily and quickly as possible. Next, have a look at the Quick Start page to get everything running. Then test some commands from the Usage page. Afterwards, you could follow one of the Tutorials. Take some nRF devices, flash them with FruityMesh and expect them to connect to each other in an instant. Open the terminal and send them some commands over the mesh, trigger LEDs or watch some data going through. Power consumption is minimal with the right settings. For a list of some of the features, have a look at the Features page. FruityMesh is great for attaching sensors / actors or 3rd party devices e.g. via UART. So if you need a mesh of lamps, sensors, want to do asset tracking, etc,…​ FruityMesh will be a great framework to get everything running quickly. We’re interested in contributions of every kind, otherwise we wouldn’t be here on GitHub. If you have questions on how to help and bring the technology forward, do not hesitate to contact us. Make sure to read the Developers page to find out how to help. Do not hesitate to ask questions, submit issues and comment. Mail us through our website for business enquiries or open an issue and label it as question for developer questions. This project is under active development at the M-Way Solutions GmbH, Germany. We use FruityMesh ourselves in conjunction with our custom MeshGateway to build services such as connected lights, asset tracking and much more for our customers.

In case there are multiple updates to be applied sequentially, this is called an update sequence. For an overview of the whole platform DFU sequence, see DFU Overview. For more information about the memory layout, see DFU & Memory Layout. The DFUModule uses a set of different error codes that must be handled differently depending on the code. Below is a table of all error codes and how they should be handled. Possible error handling types are: ok: No error handling necessary fail: Mark the whole update sequence as failed and also mark the node as failed with the error code. remove node: Remove the node from the list of nodes to update and mark it as updated (if possible mark it with: was not updated) fail only node: Mark the node as failed, remove it from the list of nodes to update and continue retry: Last command must be retried ndfu [nodeId] The Nordic Secure DFU is the DFU bootloader provided from nRF5 SDK.

Following is the data format used by the firmware as well as the definitions required for interpretation. The implementation is part of the Node class as this represents a core functionality. BlueRange IoT devices may support multiple sensors, which could e.g. be positioned on multiple lamp heads. A vendor-specific firmware extension is expected to report measurements periodically to the BlueRange sensor module. Some sensor events may be sent periodically to the BlueRange firmware, e.g. a temperature measurement could be reported every 10 minutes. Other sensor events, such as presence may need to be sent event-based. For event based sensor events it is important to know that there is no guaranteed delivery across the system. This means that a measurement may get lost. To cope with that, the following strategies exist: A state that does not need to be reported as soon as it changes should be sent in a fixed interval. E.g. a temperature may be reported every 10 minutes. A state that needs to be reported when it changes should be sent as soon as the change occurs (a threshold might be used) but should also have a fixed interval at which the current value is reported to account for lost messages. E.g. detecting if per person is present under a presence sensor or if the person went away. In case an event was missed, it will be reported with a delay of e.g. 10 Minutes. The fixed interval is chosen based on the use case and the importance of the event. Events (e.g. \"Button was pressed\") should be reported using an incrementing counter. Thereby, it can be considered as a state (e.g. button was pressed 130 times since node was started). Using these techniques it is possible to calculate the number of messages sent in a system and to balance the load. A tiny bit of glue code added to the beacon firmware receives sensor measurement values in a vendor-specific binary message format. In its simplest implementation the data is not interpreted by this firmware extension. The data is packaged in a low-level message for transport to the gateway over the mesh. Here, a message is formed that is comprised of a device and register number and the original binary message payload. Upon reception, the gateway interprets the binary payload using a sensor definition provided and maintained by the 3rd party vendor. The definition describes interpretation of data and reassembly of values in messages reported via the MQTT broker. For correct interpretation the device and register numbers are matched. For each sensor the definition specifies the expected value of the device and the register, and provides offset and length of the binary data to allow extraction. Also, data type and endianess is given as part of the definition to support the technical interpretation of the raw sensor values. Next, these raw values are scaled by a specified factor. The gateway now filters incoming values such that only changing data are reported. Finally, the up-to-date values are inserted into a sensor data JSON message published by the MQTT broker. Applications and middleware requiring sensor measurements subscribe to sensor data messages at the MQTT broker. Not all software needs all measurements. Therefore the sensor definition includes sensor type and index. These values are encoded in the message topic for filtering the required measurements. The gateway minimizes broker load by publishing only changes to the data. Newly connecting clients need to explicitly request the last known sensor values. Note that the gateway reports all sensor values automatically in case its broker connection gets lost and restored. This keeps all connected clients up to date at any time. The BlueRange server persists sensor data to be able to provide historic values. For this purpose the server is subscribed at all times. Past data reported by known devices can be queried using the BlueRange REST API. Devices may support altering reference settings or actioning of actuators. For interaction, data is passed from the outside into the vendor-specific firmware extension. Depending on the actionType, an acknowledgement is generated. The acknowledgement contains the current data of the register as if a read command had been issued. For device interaction, software such as configuration apps may set up a mesh access connection to the target device. This link allows sending arbitrary data messages directly to the vendor firmware by wrapping them in BlueRange packets. In this mode of interaction the target device is protected only by the ability of the sender establishing the mesh access link. The BlueRange system does not interpret the messages being sent and therefore can not implement further access restrictions. Also, the sender is responsible of knowing the exact capabilities of the target device such as variations in firmware versions. Higher level logic for observing and controling multiple devices is implemented in the middleware software. For actioning a device, the software publishes an environment profile act message. The BlueRange system translates the message into a number of data packets, which are sent to the devices. For translation, an environment profile must be installed on the BlueRange server. Typically, installation of the environment profile is done using a vendor-specific administration software that also securely configures the target device. The profile clearly states the actions that can be performed on the target device. It prevents the middleware logic from having to know concrete details of the target devices at byte level such as messaging.

It was the first open source implementation of a mesh network that is based on standard Bluetooth Low Energy 4.1 connections. In contrast to meshes that use advertising and scanning, this allows for a network run with battery powered devices. FruityMesh works with the Nordic nRF51 or nRF52 chipset in combination with the S130/S132 SoftDevices and enables tons of devices to connect to each other with its auto-meshing capabilities. It is always connected with configurable connection intervals of 7.5 ms to 4 seconds while still being able to run on batteries. BlueRange is our commercial product that includes our Mesh, MeshGateway, Platform, Asset Tracking and much more. Have a look at our website: https://www.bluerange.io/ It’s been a long time, but we finally released our latest version of FruityMesh with tons of new additions and a lot of refactoring and documentation. Go to the Features.adoc page to find out more. Documentation is the key and therefore, you should have a look at the documentation to get you started. You can find it as part of the repository in the doc folder: Documentation Before you begin, you should have at least two boards with the nRF51/nRF52 chipsets and either an external or an onboard debugger. If not, I suggest that you get two DevKits from Nordic to get you started as easily and quickly as possible. Next, have a look at the Quick-Start.adoc page to get everything running. Then test some commands from the Usage.adoc page. Afterwards, you could follow one of the Tutorials.adoc. Take some nRF devices, flash them with FruityMesh and expect them to connect to each other in an instant. Open the terminal and send them some commands over the mesh, trigger LEDs or watch some data going through. Power consumption is minimal with the right settings. For a list of some of the features, have a look at the Features.adoc page. FruityMesh is great for attaching sensors / actors or 3rd party devices e.g. via UART. So if you need a mesh of lamps, sensors, want to do asset tracking, etc,…​ FruityMesh will be a great framework to get everything running quickly. We’re interested in contributions of every kind, otherwise we wouldn’t be here on GitHub. If you have questions on how to help and bring the technology forward, do not hesitate to contact us. Make sure to read the Developers.adoc page to find out how to help. Do not hesitate to ask questions, submit issues and comment. Mail us through our website for business enquiries or open an issue and label it as question for developer questions. This project is under active development at the M-Way Solutions GmbH, Germany. We use FruityMesh ourselves in conjunction with our custom MeshGateway to build services such as connected lights, asset tracking and much more for our customers.

The voltage from the battery is first feed into voltage divider and then feed into one of the ADC input(AIN#) because typically the voltage range of battery is high i.e. 3V - 7V and maximum allowable at ADC input is VDD+0.3V. ADC can be configured using different reference voltage and gain settings. In our case we use reference voltage = VDD/4 where VDD is 3.3V , so our reference voltage = 0.825V and gain = 1/5. Details about reference voltage and gain can be found in the nrf52832 product specification guide. Below are some of the important formulae and measurements using our settings: The voltage out of the voltage divider is VBATT* R20/(R19+R20). e.g voltage provide by battery is 5.2V, so voltage after voltage divider will be 5.2V*110/(470+110) = 0.986V *ADC value can be calculated using the voltage value from voltage divider as follows: ADC VALUE = V * GAIN/REFERENCE * 2^RESOLUTION, where V is voltage after voltage divider ADC VALUE = 0.986 * (1/5)/0.825 * 2^10 = 244.767, where our resolution is 10 bits Build with Antora","title":"Battery Measurement Using Voltage Divider","component":"bluerange-firmware","version":"master","name":"Battery-Measurement-Using-Voltage-Divider","url":"https://www.bluerange.io/docs/opensource/bluerange-firmware/internal/Battery-Measurement-Using-Voltage-Divider.html","titles":[{"text":"\n      bluerange-firmware\n    "},{"text":"Measurement Technique","id":"_measurement_technique"},{"text":"Measurement Formulae","id":"_measurement_formulae"}]},"https://www.bluerange.io/docs/opensource/bluerange-firmware/internal/CherrySim.html":{"text":"CherrySim :: Fruitymesh Fruitymesh Quick Start Usage Features Developers Specification Modules AdvertisingModule DebugModule DfuModule EnrollmentModule IoModule MeshAccessModule Node ScanningModule StatusReporterModule Other Classes Logger RecordStorage Other Class Structure Debugging Battery Consumption RecordStorage The FruityMesh Algorithm In Detail Simulator Tutorials Implementing a Custom Module FAQ bluerange-firmware master bluerange-firmware master bluerange-firmware CherrySim CherrySim uses the codebase of FruityMesh and provides a softdevice abstraction layer that simulates bluetooth connections, advertising, flash access and much more. It basically gives us the possibility to debug, develop and simulate multiple FruityMesh nodes on a development PC. Simulates nodes in a timestep based simulation Allows easy debugging of mesh-behaviour Includes CherrySimRunner for manual testing and simulation and CherrySimTester for automatic mesh tests using the google test framework Deterministic meshing using a pseude random number generator Mesh state visualization on http://localhost:5555/ CherrySim uses a header file SystemTest.h that is force-included before all other header files to be able to abstract the softdevice. All SoftDevice calls are implemented in a way to closely mock the funcationality of a real SoftDevice. For everything that uses the radio, such as advertising or connections, a simplified simulation is used that calculates the distances between nodes and simulates packet loss. Open http://localhost:5555/ in a webbrowser while the simulator is running and simulating. The Webserver serves the FruityMap for visualization and has some endpoints that serve dynamic jsons that reflect the current mesh state. Be aware that the visualization shows the GAP connections and not the MeshConnections. This is an important difference. If all MeshConnections are handshaked, in a stable state and if there are no implementation errors, these visualizations match. The connections are presented using arrows which originate from the central and point to the peripheral. The black dots represent the connection master bits. RSSI / globalConnectionId is shown for each connection while the nodes show \"nodeId / clusterSize\". The leds are also visualized but all LED changes are mapped to a single one. The serial numbers are counting upwards, starting at BBBBB. Every forth byte of the node key, starting with the first byte is equal to the serial number index + 1. So for example, BBBBB has the node key 01:00:00:00:01:00:00:00:01:00:00:00:01:00:00:00, BBBBC has the node key 02:00:00:00:02:00:00:00:02:00:00:00:02:00:00:00 and so on. The simulator inside the docker environment has 10 nodes that take part in the mesh and additionally two assets. simGlobalStatePtr always references the GlobalState of the current node that is simulated. Only one node is simulated at a time and the GlobalState object contains the full state of a FruityMesh node. cherrySimInstance points to the simulator and can be used to access all other information cherrySimInstance→currentNode can be used to see the complete state of the current node including SoftDevice and FruityMesh state. cherrySimInstance→currentNode→currentEvent will point to the event that is being processed. This can contain additional information under additionalInfo such as the globalPacketId for all write events. cherrySimInstance→nodes provides access to all nodes in the simulation. simFicrPtr, simUicrPtr, simGpioPtr, simFlashPtr point to the simulated hardware peripherals of the currently simulated node. It is very useful to use conditional breakpoints for debugging when analysing a certain situation. Because of the PSRNG, the same situation can be reproduced as often as desired and logs and more can added or modified (as long as the meshing behaviour is not changed). Conditional Breakpoints can be used for: globalEventIdCounter: A different id is given to each event so that breakpoints can be set for specific events. globalConnHandleCounter: Each connection is given a globally unique id so they can be tracked easily (After a long simulation, these will wrap and a warning will be printed) globalPacketIdCounter: Each packet is assigned a global id so that the creation of the packet can be debugged. This is usefuly as packet creation and processing of the packet happen asynchronously and are not directly linked. Check the additionalInfo of the currentEvent during debugging and break in the sd_ble_gattc_write when this is assigned. If you want to break in the debugger before some error happens, you can write: static int counter = 0; counter++; Then check the value of the counter in the debugger, set a conditional breakpoint some lines before your error happened and compare the counter value against the count from the previous run. The simulator has a terminal that allows you to input all commands that can be used with FruityMesh nodes. Depending on the simulator configuration, either no terminal is enabled (-1), all terminals are active (0) or the terminal of a specific node is active, for example 1. The active terminals can be switched at runtime by using the term command, e.g.: term 1 The simulator provides a set of terminal commands as well that you can input via the terminal. The most important one simstat will give you an overview of all available commands. Also, a number of SIMSTATCOUNT and SIMSTATAVG macros are spread throughout the code that are used to collect statistics. The results will also be shown by that command. Using commands such as nodes 20, width 40, height 50 will let you modify the simulation scenario. You can also import scenarios as json files by first giving the paths and then enabling json import (json 1). Each simulation is always run deterministic with a preset seed. You can modify this seed using e.g. seed 123 which will give you a new simulation.

Currently mesh is only working in High Discovery Mode (i.e Broadcasting at advertising interval 100 ms and scanning with scanning window interval 20 ms and scanning window 3 ms). In future, we want the mesh to be in Low Discovery Mode (i.e Broadcasting at advertising interval 200 ms and scanning with scanning window interval 250 ms and scanning window 3 ms) and only switches into High Discovery Mode when it discovers new nodes. Beacons were flashed with prod_mesh_nrf52 configuration while taking battery measurements. Measurement for both High and Low discovery are as follows: Consumes on average 890 uA when in mesh. Consumes on average 760 uA when not in mesh. Scan 50-55 packets of all the nearby nodes every 30 sec. Scan 10-12 joinMe packets every 30 sec from a single device advertising at interval 200ms. time to connect to other node = 100 ms - 400 ms. Consumes on average 460 uA when in mesh. Consumes on average 220 uA when not in mesh. Scan 15-20 packets from all the nearby nodes every 30 sec.

Currently, the ClcModule uses the ClcComm for the UART Communication with the regent controller and the ClcAppConnection for communicating with the Tunable White App. For Specification of the Communication, look at: Pflichtenheft Software Connected Lighting Module v1.6-inWork4.pdf Software Definition Kommunikationsablauf App - Leuchte v1.3.pdf Internally, regent uses modbus, and we use a very similar structure to communicate with their controller and send that information to our cloud. prod_clc_mesh_nrf52 Runs on the clc module prod_clc_sink_nrf51 Special build necessary for the MeshGateway used by regent that can convert clc messages into json format (Should be made part of general sink) Do these steps in this order, otherwise, the CLC might get destroyed. Only plug in lamp power in the end! Attach the Connector to the plug near the BLE module (as shown in the picture). The \"CPU\" marking should point to the nearby cpu. Attach the clc to a debugger (Debugger must be switched off or disconnected from USB) Attach the clc to the lamp. Plug in the power of the lamp. Switch on the debugger. ⇒ When disconnecting, switch off Debugger first, then power off lamp. You can use Segger RTT to work with a terminal if activated because the UART is occupied and used between the two chips. Attach the debug connector to the other plug in the corner of the board Chipset is STM32F091CC (no optional bytes), SWD (speed 1000) Use JFlashLite 5.10u (Newer versions do not work with a nordic branded segger debugger) Flash the new binary You can also erase the board first, but the clcloader.hex has to be flashed first and then the new firmware You must reset the board manually (pressing the reset button on the debugger might work) Firmware updates can be .img, .bin, .hex. When flashing the CLC, the .hex has to be used. The one packaged in component updates is the .img version. The .bin version is only used when updating the lamp with the batch files from regent. To test the firmware update, FruityDeploy can be used to flash the update binary on the node directly. //FruityDeploy flashing: dfuparams --args dev_clc_mesh_nrf52 --dfuimage clm-01.12.XX-4b344bbf-rel.img --dfuparams 0 61440 65 //To test the update request clc updatereq 15 //To start the update for testing //params: , , clc update 15 266240 61440 Build with Antora","title":"Regent / ClcModuleSetup","component":"bluerange-firmware","version":"master","name":"readme","url":"https://www.bluerange.io/docs/opensource/bluerange-firmware/regent/readme.html","titles":[{"text":"\n      bluerange-firmware\n    "},{"text":"General","id":"_general"},{"text":"Featuresets","id":"_featuresets"},{"text":"Flashing and developing FruityMesh on the CLC","id":"_flashing_and_developing_fruitymesh_on_the_clc"},{"text":"Flashing the Regent Controller","id":"_flashing_the_regent_controller"},{"text":"Debugging","id":"_debugging"},{"text":"Testing the Firmware Update","id":"_testing_the_firmware_update"},{"text":"Component Updates","id":"_component_updates"}]},"https://www.bluerange.io/docs/opensource/bluerange-firmware/vossloh/VsModule.html":{"text":"VsModule :: Fruitymesh Fruitymesh Quick Start Usage Features Developers Specification Modules AdvertisingModule DebugModule DfuModule EnrollmentModule IoModule MeshAccessModule Node ScanningModule StatusReporterModule Other Classes Logger RecordStorage Other Class Structure Debugging Battery Consumption RecordStorage The FruityMesh Algorithm In Detail Simulator Tutorials Implementing a Custom Module FAQ bluerange-firmware master bluerange-firmware master bluerange-firmware VsModule The VsModule contains the whole customer specific logic for vossloh.

Connecting the devboard to USB via its USB/UART connector (1) will power the board. Connecting it via the multiple Jlink adaptors (2) allows us to flash the nRF52840 chip. 1: USB / Serial adapter and board power 2: Segger Jlink Connection 3: MicroSd card reader for firmware updates 4: BLE module with button and rotary encorders 5: Waldmann host controller ATSAMD51N19A on main board (BLE module can also be plugged in here 6: Multiple serial sockets 7: Development PCB with some buttons and connectors Each of the module sockets (black) or the serial cable sockets (white) on the main board (5) are connected to the host controller and have a specific (src/dst) id. The host controller will do routing between these ids. The Waldmann controller does not need to be flashed, but will be updated using the microSd card reader. When using the button firmware update, the update will be done each time, downgrade and the same version will work as well. Put the microSd in a PC card reader Copy the firmware update to \\WA\\IMAGE (E.g. the file is V00_01_s.bin) Unplug the serial adapter (1) Put the microSd card into the card reader (3) hold down the blue button on the host controller PCB (5) and plug in the serial adapter, then let go of the blue button after a second. The LED on the host controller board should be on and stay on for about 15 to 20 seconds. Afterwards, it will go off. For Waldmann the profileId is used as the register and the nodeAddress (e.g. 0x00 for the main controller) is used to address the attached device that should react on this profile. The actionType is currently unused as the profiles do not have a direction distinction. The following message can be used to switch an LED off: rltn-iot/ORGANIZATION_UUID/SITE_UUID/BLENODE_UUID/rwio/WM_MODULE/0-4194/write { \"register\":4194, \"data\":\"AAA=\", \"length\":2, \"module\":\"WM_MODULE\", \"component\":0, \"timestamp\":12345 } Below are some helpful commands for testing //Activate LED 55 02 00 10 62 00 20 10 00 20 14 3B 6E //Ack for activate LED 55 01 00 00 A1 10 00 00 20 00 88 D2 //Tunnel message 55 05 00 90 62 00 20 10 00 00 00 00 00 77 89 41 //Sending tunnel data via terminal raw_data_light 0 155 0 62:90:20:00:00:10:77 //Fake LED message for testing led off 55 02 00 10 62 00 20 10 00 00 00 6F 3D //Fake LED message for testing led on 55 02 00 10 62 00 20 10 00 01 00 5C 0C //For reference component_act [nodeId] [moduleId] [actionType] [component] [registerAddress] [dataHex] //Switch the LED of the host on component_act 0 155 0 0x00 0x1062 02:14 //Switch the LED of the host off component_act 0 155 0 0x00 0x1062 00:00 //Reset the host (no ack) component_act 0 155 0 0x00 0x74 00 Build with Antora","title":"General","component":"bluerange-firmware","version":"master","name":"readme","url":"https://www.bluerange.io/docs/opensource/bluerange-firmware/waldmann/readme.html","titles":[{"text":"\n      bluerange-firmware\n    "},{"text":"Development","id":"_development"},{"text":"Featuresets","id":"_featuresets"},{"text":"Setup","id":"_setup"},{"text":"Updating the Waldmann Controller","id":"_updating_the_waldmann_controller"},{"text":"Sensor Messages","id":"_sensor_messages"},{"text":"Component Updates","id":"_component_updates"},{"text":"Test Commands","id":"_test_commands"}]}}}
